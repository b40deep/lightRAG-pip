The rising incidence of Diabetes Type 2 is related to the effects of urbanization and unhealthy lifestyles. Research studies show that healthy eating and regular physical activity can prevent or delay the onset of Diabetes Type 2, even in high-risk individuals.</p>\n<p>Early detection and effective management may be associated with a normal lifespan and quality of life. Lifestyle modification, behavioural change, team decision-making and self-care will aid every individual with diabetes to manage his/her condition and prevent deterioration and complications.</p>\n<p>The implementation of this updated guideline, as one of the tools available to manage diabetes, will, with the cooperation of the patients and relevant health professionals, achieve the reduction of complications of diabetes and the reduction of premature mortality from diabetes. The guideline is an integral part of the Diabetes Implementation Strategy for South Africa, which was developed in response to the African Diabetes Declaration and Strategy.</p>\n<p>Health professionals should acquire the relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for successful management of diabetes, so that patients can be empowered with the necessary information and skills. Support from family, friends, community and health professionals is encouraged.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank all the role players who have given many hours of their time to the development of this guideline. This collaborative effort, involving experts in various fields, has resulted in a single guideline being available in South Africa.</p>\n<p>___________________</p>\n<p>Dr A Motsoaledi (MP) Minister of Health</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_2_Picture_10.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h1>Statement by the Deputy Minister</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_3_Picture_1.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>The effective implementation of this diabetes guideline will support the Negotiated Service Delivery Agreement objectives of 'increasing life expectancy' and 'decreasing maternal mortality'.</p>\n<p>This guideline will also support the achievement of some of the ambitious targets that have been set by the department, towards reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases by 2020. These targets arose from the Non-Communicable Diseases Summit held in September 2011.</p>\n<p>Prevention, screening, diagnosis, non-pharmacological and pharmacological management are included, as well as prevention and management of complications and emergencies.</p>\n<p>Persons diagnosed with diabetes, will receive comprehensive diabetes care, and will enter into a partnership with the relevant health professionals so that they may live well and healthy into old age.</p>\n<p>_________________</p>\n<p>Dr G Ramokgopa Deputy Minister: Health</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<h1>Acknowledgements by the Director General</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>It is with very sincere appreciation that I acknowledge, on behalf of the Department of Health, the roles played by the various experts in the development of this collaborative national guideline, Updated Management of type 2 diabetes in Adults at Primary Care Level.</p>\n<p>Particular thanks are due to the members of the SEMDSA Steering Committee and the Advisory Committee, who were representing their respective organisations.

The insidious and initially asymptomatic nature of the disease results in persons not seeking early medical attention, so that 30-85% of cases of type 2 diabetes are undiagnosed. At eventual diagnosis, approximately 20% of patients will have complications of the disease.</p>\n<p>The conservative South African estimate is that 6.5% of adults aged 20-79 years have diabetes. The effects of urbanisation and an unhealthy lifestyle are important contributors to the rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes. The 2003 South Africa Demographic and Health Survey showed that 55% of women and 30% of men, aged 15 years and older, are overweight or obese.</p>\n<p>Effective prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes requires a paradigm shift from a patient-centred approach to a \"whole of government\" and a \"whole of society\" approach. Hence, government departments such as Agriculture, Trade and Industry, Sport and Recreation, Basic Education amongst others, together with non-governmental organizations, need to join forces with Health in preventing and combating diabetes. Collaborating partners must effectively work together at all levels of service delivery.</p>\n<p>It is imperative that focused screening of high-risk persons be introduced, to improve the rate of early detection, thereby reducing late entry - with established long-term complications - into the health system.</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p>Early, good control of glycaemia, blood pressure and dyslipidaemia, together with regular examinations for micro- and macrovascular complications, with appropriate and timely interventions, is the only way to prevent or reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p>Well organized clinics, with staff suitably trained in diabetes care using effective protocols and appropriate tools (SA Diabetes Declaration Implementation Strategy; Long-term care model Implementation Plan; National Guideline: Non-Communicable Diseases: A Strategic Vision, Chronic Diseases Indicators and Records) together with these updated guidelines, will facilitate improved quality of diabetes care. Appropriate monitoring of the application of the available tools, together with effective Clinic management and treatment management, will result in increased numbers of patients with controlled diabetes and a consequent reduction in numbers of complications.</p>\n<p>Many individuals may present with the characteristic symptoms of diabetes (thirst, polyuria (frequent urination), weight loss and blurring of vision) but some individuals, especially older persons, may be asymptomatic. The <strong>acute complications</strong> of diabetes are hypoglycaemia [usually as a complication of therapy] and uncontrolled hyperglycaemia [due to improper management and/or patient non-adherence], whilst the <strong>long-term relatively specific</strong> effects of diabetes include the development of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.</p>\n<p>People with diabetes are also at increased risk of other diseases, including cardiac, peripheral arterial and cerebrovascular disease.</p>\n<p>The metabolic syndrome - abdominal obesity, elevated serum triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol, hypertension, elevated fasting blood glucose level - increases the risk of developing diabetes approximately 5-fold and doubles the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p>Diabetes, regardless of its aetiology, progresses through several clinical stages during its natural history. The spectrum of glucose tolerance extends from normoglycaemia, to intermediate hyperglycaemia (impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) to diabetes.</p>\n<h4><strong>IFG and IGT are high-risk states for developing diabetes.</strong></h4>\n<p>Patient education is imperative - an informed patient can make informed decisions regarding his/her diabetes management and will remind the health professional of the various tests that should be performed during her/his visit to the health facility.</p>\n<p>All health professionals (including Health Promoters and Community Health Workers, lay health workers, and traditional and complementary healers) should promote healthy living and know the common risk factors for developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and cancers; they should also know and recognize the symptoms of diabetes,",

These include processes that impair or destroy the function of the pancreatic beta cells, with consequent <em>insulin deficiency</em>, and others that result in resistance to insulin action (<em>insulin resistance/insulin insensitivity).</em> The abnormalities of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism are due to deficient action of insulin on target tissues resulting from insensitivity or lack of insulin or both.</p>\n<h4><strong>SYMPTOMS of diabetes</strong></h4>\n<p>| Characteristic symptoms: | polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss              |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Other symptoms:          | blurring of vision                             |\n|                          | general body weakness and lethargy             |\n|                          | susceptibility to infections, especially skin, |\n|                          | urogenital tract and respiratory tract         |\n|                          | pruritus vulvae                                |\n|                          | poor wound healing                             |</p>\n<p>Symptoms may not be severe, or may be absent.</p>\n<h4>10<strong>DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES AND OTHER CATEGORIES OF INTERMEDIATE GLYCAEMIA 2,3,4,5,6</strong></h4>\n<p>For clinical purposes, the diagnosis of diabetes should always be confirmed by repeating the same test on another day.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis of diabetes should be based on formal laboratory test results (not point of care tests) prior to the initiation of any therapy.</p>\n<h4><em>Table 1 Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes and categories of intermediate hyperglycaemia</em></h4>\n<p>| Diagnostic test                                                                     | Impaired Fasting Glucose<br>(IFG) | Impaired Glucose<br>Tolerance (IGT) | Diabetes                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Random plasma glucose<br>(RPG) i                                                    | –                                 | –                                   | ≥ 11.1 mmol/L if classic<br>symptoms of diabetes or<br>hyperglycaemic crisisii is<br>present; or |\n| Fasting plasma glucose<br>(FPG) iii                                                 | 6.1 –",

HbA1c reduction ranges from 1.5 – 2 %</p>\n<p><em>Insulin</em>: Patients with type 2 diabetes often require insulin to achieve glycaemic control, thus insulin may be added to other therapies, as second- or third-line therapy.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_19_Picture_13.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h4><strong>STEPS 1 – 3 TO ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE GLYCAEMIC MANAGEMENT</strong></h4>\n<p>All the required tests at the initial visit, must be completed.</p>\n<h4><strong>ENTRY TO STEP 1</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>At diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, after the required tests have been completed, including serum creatinine/eGFR.</li>\n<li>If patient is thin (BMI &lt;20kg/m2 ), refer to hospital level care.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>STEP 1</strong></h4>\n<p>Lifestyle modification + metformin (biguanide) for 3 months</p>\n<p>| STEPS                  | TREATMENT AND<br>DURATION                                                                                                                                                  | TARGET                                           | CAUTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | CONTRA<br>INDICATIONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Lifestyle modification | For life<br>•<br>provide<br>appropriate<br>eating plan;<br>•<br>provide weight<br>loss plan until<br>ideal weight is<br>reached<br>•<br>assess monthly<br>until stabilised | HbA1c &lt; 7<br>Body weight reduced<br>by 5 -10%    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Metformin, oral        | 500mg daily x 2<br>weeks<br>500mg 12 hourly x 2<br>weeks<br>850mg 12 hourly X 2<br>weeks<br>850mg 8 hourly                                                                 | MAX: 2550mg daily,<br>in 2 or 3 divided<br>doses | Use with care in<br>the elderly if serum<br",

Assess clinical <strong>and</strong> biochemical response over the next 5 -10 minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>If blood glucose remains &lt; 4.4 mmol/L give a second IV injection of 20 50ml 50% dextrose.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Continue IV infusion of 5% Dextrose in Water, at a rate of about 1 litre in 6 hours (to prevent recurrent hypoglycaemia, particularly if induced by long acting insulin and/or sulphonylurea agents).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>NOTE: For patients that are alcoholic, malnourished, mal-absorbers etc. – continue IV infusion with 5% Dextrose in Water + Thiamine 100mg IMI</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Once blood glucose is normal or elevated, and the patient is awake, provide patient with a snack.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>If the <strong>patient has not regained consciousness</strong> after <strong>30 minutes,</strong> despite a normal or elevated blood glucose, other causes of coma will need to be considered (e.g. meningitis). <strong>Urgent referral to hospital is indicated.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Refer all hypoglycaemic patients to hospital for observation and education to prevent further hypoglycaemic episodes.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>In hospital, monitor the clinical state and blood glucose 4-hourly for 24 48 hours.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Always try to identify the underlying cause of the hypoglycaemic episode.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Important points to remember:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>• If hypoglycaemia was caused by a sulphonylurea, the patient may need hospitalisation and IV dextrose/glucose infusion for several days - especially if glibenclamide was the cause.</li>\n<li>• Honey or syrup may be rubbed in the gums of patients losing consciousness if other medication is not readily at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Patient education:</strong></h4>\n<p>All diabetic patients must receive education on the recognition and treatment of hypoglycaemia.</p>\n<p>It is essential that the cause of each hypoglycaemic episode is established and appropriate preventive action taken to prevent further episodes.</p>\n<h4><strong>Recurrent hypoglycaemia:</strong></h4>\n<p>Patients who experience recurrent severe hypoglycaemic reactions should be given more intensive adherence and monitoring counselling.</p>\n<p>All patients with recurrent hypoglycaemia should be referred to hospital for assessment.</p>\n<p>Updated Management Of Type 2 Diabe tes In Adults At Primary Care Level</p>\n<p>Consider the following in cases of recurrient hypoglycaemia:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• inappropriate management;</li>\n<li>• poor adherence to treatment regimen and management plan;</li>\n<li>• alcohol abuse;</li>\n<li>• self-induced hypoglycaemia</li>\n<li>• the advent of renal failure</li>\n<li>• hypoglycaemia unawareness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Hypoglycaemia awareness:</strong></h4>\n<p>Recurrent hypoglycaemia may be the cause <strong>or</strong> consequence of hypoglycaemic unawareness.</p>\n<p>This complication occurs after some years of diabetes and is associated with hypoglycaemia-associated autonomic failure. These patients do not exhibit the early symptoms of hypoglycaemia, and consequently present with neuroglycopenia (confusion, seizures, coma).</p>\n<p>Evidence exists that in some of these individuals scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycaemia for several weeks can reverse hypoglycaemic unawareness.</p>\n<h4><strong>HYPERGLYCAEMIC EMERGENCIES 13,14,15</strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>(1) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>(2) Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS)</strong></h4>\n<p>DKA and HHS should be suspected whenever patients have significant hyperglycaemia, especially if they are systemically unwell or are known to have diabetes.</p>\n<p>These conditions have significant morbidity and mortality, and emergency treatment with intravenous fluids and insulin is essential.</p>\n<h4><strong>1.

DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS [DKA]</strong></h4>\n<p>DKA is characterised by uncontrolled hyperglycaemia, metabolic acidosis and increased total body ketones. In South Africa, DKA carries a higher mortality than in the developed world. It can present at any age although it is more common in young patients.</p>\n<p>An acute DKA episode usually develops within 24 hours</p>\n<h4><strong>2. HYPERGLYCAEMIC HYPEROSMOLAR STATE [HHS]</strong></h4>\n<p>Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state is characterised by the slow development of marked hyperglycaemia (usually &gt; 50 mmol/L), hyperosmolality and severe dehydration. Ketonuria may be slight or absent. The condition usually affects middle-aged or older patients and carries a high mortality.</p>\n<p>HHS usually evolves over several days to weeks.</p>\n<h4>28<em>Clinical features</em></h4>\n<p>For both DKA and HHS the classical clinical picture includes a history of</p>\n<p>polyuria,</p>\n<p>polydipsia,</p>\n<p>vomiting,</p>\n<p>dehydration,</p>\n<p>weight loss,</p>\n<p>weakness and</p>\n<p>change in mental status (can vary from mild confusion to profound lethargy or coma, the latter is more common in HHS).</p>\n<p>Focal neurological signs and seizures may occur in HHS.</p>\n<p>Patients with DKA commonly complain of diffuse abdominal pain. Physical findings may include Kussmaul breathing (in DKA only) or shock, with hypotension and tachycardia.</p>\n<p>History taking and examination should not delay the initial investigations, management and referral to hospital.</p>\n<h4><em>Precipitating factors of DKA and HHS</em></h4>\n<p>• Infection is the most common precipitating factor in DKA and HHS.</p>\n<p>Other precipitants include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>discontinuation of insulin,</li>\n<li>myocardial infarction (MI) or</li>\n<li>cerebrovascular accident (CVA).</li>\n<li>• In elderly patients, restricted water intake due to the patient being bedridden can lead to dehydration and precipitate HHS. Drugs such as diuretics may exacerbate the condition.</li>\n<li>• In addition, new-onset diabetes commonly leads to DKA in patients with type 1 diabetes and HHS in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</li>\n<li>• In a significant proportion of patients, no precipitant may be identified.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><em>Treatment of Hyperglycaemic Coma at Primary Care Level</em></h4>\n<h4><strong>Rapid</strong> treatment <strong>and referral</strong> is essential.</h4>\n<p>The following steps should be followed:</p>\n<p>• Confirm diagnosis</p>\n<p>Check capillary glucose and urine ketones to confirm hyperglycaemia and ketonuria.</p>\n<p>Be cautious in renal and cardiac disease.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• In the absence of renal or cardiac compromise, administer intravenous (IV) fluids, starting with normal saline, 15–20 ml/kg in the first hour</li>\n<li>Subsequent infusion rate: 10 ml/kg/hour with 20 ml/kg boluses if shocked.</li>\n<li>Do not exceed 50 ml/kg in the first 4 hours.</li>\n<li>Correct estimated deficits over 24 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the older patient with suspected HHS or cardiac compromise, change to 0.45% saline after the first litre of normal saline.</p>\n<p>• Insulin</p>\n<p>When referral will take more than 2 hours and a diagnosis of diabetes with hyperglycaemia is confirmed, administer short acting insulin, IM, 0.1 unit/kg.</p>\n<p>– When giving insulin IM, do not use insulin needle.</p>\n<h4><strong>CAUTION</strong></h4>\n<p>Do not administer IV short-acting insulin if the serum electrolyte status, especially potassium, is not known.</p>\n<p>Continue with IV fluids but delay giving insulin in these cases in consultation with referral facility as this delay should not negatively influence the patient, but hypokalaemia with resultant cardiac dysrhythmias definitely will.</p>\n<p>See section 8.6.2: Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and Hyperosmolar Nonketotic Diabetic Coma (HONK) of the STG and EML for Hospital Level (Adult), 2012 edition</p>\n<h4><strong>Refer urgently with drip in place and running at planned rate.</strong></h4>\n<h4><em>Table 7: Differentiation between the types of hyperglycaemic coma</em></h4>\n<p>|                   | DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)                                                                      | HYPERGLYCAEMIC<br>HYPEROSMOLAR COMA (HHS)",

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF FOOT PROBLEMS IN DIABETES 37,38,39,40,41,42,43</strong></h4>\n<p>This section aims to highlight the morbidity and mortality associated with distal peripheral sensory diabetic neuropathy and its sequelae, and the measures that should be undertaken to prevent these.</p>\n<p>Ulceration and amputation are preventable complications, and the health care provider should implement the measures outlined here in order to ensure optimal patient outcomes.</p>\n<h4><strong>Defining the problem</strong></h4>\n<p>Foot problems are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes and contribute to increased health care costs.</p>\n<p>In people with neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease, minor trauma to the foot leads to skin ulceration, infection and ultimately gangrene, resulting in amputation. After amputation of one limb, the prognosis for the contra-lateral limb is poor.</p>\n<p>In the North American population foot complications account for 20% of all diabetes-related hospital admissions – unfortunately these data do not exist in South Africa.</p>\n<h4><strong>Risk factors for ulceration.</strong></h4>\n<p>Characteristics that have been shown to confer high risk of ulceration include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• previous ulceration,</li>\n<li>• neuropathy,</li>\n<li>• structural deformity and limited joint mobility,</li>\n<li>• peripheral vascular disease and</li>\n<li>• microvascular complications ie. retinopathy, nephropathy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Understanding how ulcers develop</strong></h4>\n<p>Peripheral sensory neuropathy is present, to some degree, in more than 50% of people with diabetes who are older than 60 years. Peripheral neuropathy must usually be profound before leading to loss of the protective sensation; the consequent vulnerability to physical and thermal trauma increases the risk of foot ulceration 7-fold.</p>\n<p>A second causative factor in foot ulceration is excessive plantar pressure.</p>\n<p>A third component is trauma, particularly when repetitive.</p>\n<p>PAD with obstruction of the arteries to the lower legs and feet also increases the risk of ulceration, and is a crucial factor in the delayed healing of foot ulcers.</p>\n<p>People with PAD may present with symptoms of ischaemia, such as claudication, rest pain, ulceration or gangrene. It is important to remember that people with diabetes often present without any history of these typical symptoms of ischaemia, because most of them also have established peripheral neuropathy.</p>\n<p>PAD in people with diabetes also occurs at an earlier age and progresses more rapidly.</p>\n<h4><strong>Prevention of foot ulceration and amputation</strong></h4>\n<p>A foot examination should be performed on diagnosis of diabetes. The frequency of further foot examinations should be in accordance with the 'risk categorisation system for diabetic feet'. Health care professionals trained in the assessment of feet should examine the patient's feet to detect risk factors for ulceration.</p>\n<p>Foot assessment forms should be available and should include foot history and results of the foot examination.</p>\n<h4><strong>REFER: Annexure C1</strong></h4>\n<p>Effective foot care involves a partnership between the patient and/or family member/care giver and the health care personnel, who will provide the relevant foot care advice. All foot care management decisions should be agreed upon by all parties. The management plan should include promotion of self-care, ongoing foot care education and referral to the appropriate specialist as required (podiatrist, vascular unit, orthotist, surgeon, wound care unit).</p>\n<p>The older person with poor vision and mobility, who is socially",

A meta-analysis of 15 studies suggested that the relative risk of having a motor vehicle accident for people with diabetes as a whole (without differentiating those with a significant risk from those with little or no risk) as compared with the general population, ranges between 1.126 and 1.19, a 12-19% increased risk.</p>\n<p>Society tolerates much higher relative risks associated with a variety of other situations (such a sleep apnoea, the very young driver (s) with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder).</p>\n<p>It would thus be unjustified to restrict driving privileges of an entire class of individuals, such as drivers with diabetes.</p>\n<p>The most significant subgroup of persons with diabetes, for whom a greater degree of restrictions is often applied across the rest of the world, is drivers managing their diabetes with insulin. Insulin therapy <em>per se</em> has not been found to be associated with increased driving risk. The single most significant factor in collisions involving drivers with diabetes, appears to be a recent history of severe hypoglycaemia (regardless of diabetes type or treatment used).</p>\n<h4><strong>• Recommendations for the South African situation</strong></h4>\n<p>Generally, fitness to drive should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and should be based on concrete evidence of actual risk.</p>\n<p>Healthcare professionals should be knowledgeable and regularly discuss ways to reduce the risks of driving with their patients who have diabetes.</p>\n<p>Persons with diabetes should take an active role in assessing their ability to drive and in obtaining information about the recognition, treatment and avoidance of hypoglycaemia.</p>\n<p>Adeguate blood glucose test strips should be provided to persons with diabetes who drive, to cover additional testing before and during driving periods, if necessary.</p>\n<h4><strong>Private vehicles</strong></h4>\n<p>Irrespective of treatment regimen or diabetes type, persons with diabetes should have no restrictions in general, provided:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• He/she has regular medical supervision with a minimum of 2 clinic visits per year</li>\n<li>• High-risk patients are offered targeted education and advice</li>\n<li>• Patients who have experienced severe hypoglycaemic events or hypoglycaemic unawareness, have consulted their healthcare providers to determine whether it is safe to drive and to target interventions to avoid further episodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Commercial vehicles</strong></h4>\n<p>The South African law should provide clear guidance for annual assessment and clear criteria for holding a commercial licence.</p>\n<p>Candidates with diabetes who apply for commercial licences should have an initial full medical assessment, with annual reassessments by a specialist physician, endocrinologist or family physician trained in diabetes management, including a review of medical records and glucometer readings of the previous 24 months.</p>\n<p>The following standards should apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• No severe hypoglycaemic event (requiring assistance from another person) has occurred in the previous 6 months</li>\n<li>• The driver has full hypoglycaemic awareness</li>\n<li>\n<p>• The driver shows adequate control of his/her condition with regular blood glucose monitoring at least twice daily, and at times relevant to driving</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>• The driver demonstrates an understanding of the risks of hypoglycaemia</p>\n</li>\n<li>• None of the following potentially dangerous complications or co-morbidities associated with diabetes are present:</li>\n<li>Sight-threatening retinopathy or cataracts (a full eye examination by",

TUBERCULOSIS (TB) AND DIABETES</strong></h4>\n<p>According to the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, 2011 - Collaborative Framework for Care and Control of Tuberculosis and Diabetes (Provisional collaborative framework, 2011. Expiry date, 2015), the links between tuberculosis and diabetes are clearly identified.</p>\n<p>The prevalence of TB is considerably higher among people with diabetes than in the general population. People with diabetes have a triple risk of developing tuberculosis.</p>\n<p>Individuals with both conditions will require careful clinical management.</p>\n<h4><strong>Recommendations in the framework include:</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Surveillance of TB among patients with diabetes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At a minimum, people diagnosed with diabetes should, at the time of this diagnosis, and at each regular check-up for diabetes, be asked about the presence of cough <strong>lasting more than 2 weeks.</strong> </p>\n<p>A standardised 4-symptom screening tool should be used – cough lasting more than 2 weeks; loss of weight; night sweats; fever.</p>\n<p>Persons with one or more symptoms should be investigated for TB.</p>\n<p>Confirmed TB will require immediate initiation of treatment (refer \"National TB Management Guidelines\" for treatment protocols) with patients being monitored closely for side-effects of treatment, drug interactions and evidence of hyperglycaemia.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Surveillance of diabetes among patients with TB</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Patients with TB should be screened for diabetes at the start of their TB treatment as part of the basic clinical package. Abnormal glucose values should be confirmed and analysed. Persons with confirmed diabetes will be managed in accordance with this guideline.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Health-care facilities should have in place an infection control plan that includes administrative and environmental control measures to reduce transmission of TB within health-care settings</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>National programmes should agree (i) a core set of process and outcome indicators to accelerate the implementation of collaborative activities in South Africa, and (ii) tools to collect data for monitoring and evaluating activities to improve care and prevention of both diseases.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>D10. PERIODONTAL (GUM) DISEASE AND DIABETES</strong></h4>\n<p>Research proved a significant relevance between diabetes and periodontal disease.</p>\n<h4><strong>Periodontal disease consists of:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>• <em>Gingivitis</em>caused by plaque which collects around the neck of teeth. Inflammation is present and the gingiva bleeds easily, and is red and swollen. Gingivitis is reversible if good oral hygiene practices are <strong>timely</strong> implemented. Refer patient to an oral hygienist.</li>\n<li>• <em>Periondontitis</em>inflammation surrounding the tooth root. It is when the periodontal ligament [which connects the tooth root to alveolar (tooth socket) bone] is destroyed. It is caused by tooth plaque and calculus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Poorly controlled and uncontrolled diabetes increase periodontitis. The normal gingival sulcus around the tooth deepens and a pocket forms. A deeper pocket collects more bacteria which infects the mouth by causing inflammation which reduces the effectiveness of insulin produced in the body. Proper control of blood sugar levels decreases.</p>\n<h4><strong>Refer patient to a dentist",

These patients would require rehabilitation services.</p>\n<p>Rehabilitation services must occur within a multidisciplinary approach. A variety of professional staff should contribute to the overall management of the patient, with the patient and family member and/or caregiver being integral to the effective functioning of the multidisciplinary team. The family member/caregiver should be involved throughout the rehabilitation process.</p>\n<p>A patient/client who requires rehabilitation should be identified and referred early in order to derive maximum benefit from therapeutic interventions. Early intervention is also important in preventing complications that might arise as a result of disuse or wrong use of certain parts of the body.</p>\n<p>Rehabilitation will focus on empowering patients through detailed rehabilitation plans, home programmes as well as the provision of technical aids and devices (e.g. wheelchairs, low vision aids, white canes) when required.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_58_Picture_1.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h1>REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>The development of this guideline was a collaborative effort between the members of the SEMDSA Steering Committee and the Advisory Committee, of which the Department of Health was a member.</p>\n<p>A complete list of references is available in the publication \"The 2012 SEMDSA Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes\" in JEMDSA 2012;17 (1) S1-S94.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>International Diabetes Federation.IDF Diabetes Atlas c 2003 (cited 2012 March 18) Available from: http: //www.idf.org/ diabetesatlas.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Alberti KG, Zimmet PZ.

Never cut down the corners of the toenails as this may cause ingrown toenails. If the toenails cannot be cut, file them downwards. If your vision is impaired, ask someone to do this for you.</li>\n<li>• Sharp instruments must never be used to dig around toenails.</li>\n<li>• Never cut corns or calluses yourself or use corn plasters, other chemicals or other remedies. These preparations are acidic and often cause ulcers. Consult a health-care professional. Corns and calluses are an indication of a problem.</li>\n<li>• Avoid anything that restricts the blood flow to your feet. Never wear garters or socks with tight elastic tops.</li>\n<li>• Stop/reduce smoking as this adversely affects circulation.</li>\n<li>• During cold weather, always remove all heating mechanisms (like heater, hot water bottle) BEFORE getting into bed.</li>\n<li>• Remember to test the temperature of bath water before getting in. If unable to do so, let someone else test it. Avoid using very hot water when bathing.</li>\n<li>• Proper footwear is very important for the older person. It is bad for your feet and posture to wear slippers all day.</li>\n<li>• Persons with diabetes should never walk barefoot when outdoors.</li>\n<li>• Report every injury, blister, cut, scratch or sore that develops, to the health professional.</li>\n<li>• Have the feet professionally examined at least once a year at nearest clinic or hospital.</li>\n<li>• Look into shoes or feel inside them for objects before putting them on.</li>\n<li>•",

This explains why the level of HbA1c can increase or decrease relatively quickly with large changes in glucose.</p>\n<p>HbA1c is a useful tool for guiding therapy and predicting outcomes.</p>\n<h1>ANNEXURE F</h1>\n<h2><strong>A GUIDE TO PATIENT ADHERENCE IN CHRONIC CONDITIONS</strong></h2>\n<p>Achieving health goals for chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, HIV and AIDS, epilepsy, hypertension, mental health disorders and TB requires attention to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• Adherence to long term pharmacotherapy incomplete or non-adherence can lead to failure of an otherwise sound pharmacotherapeutic regimen.</li>\n<li>• Organization of health care services, which includes consideration of access to medicines and continuity of care</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Patient Adherence</strong></h4>\n<p>Adherence is the extent to which a person's behaviour – taking medication, following a diet and/or executing lifestyle changes - corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider.</p>\n<p>Poor adherence results in less than optimal management and control of the illness and is often the primary reason for suboptimal clinical benefit.

The successful integration of the regimen is informed by the extent to which the regimen differs from his or her established daily routine. Where the pharmacological proprieties of the medication permits it, the pharmacotherapy dosing regimen should be adapted to the patient's daily routine. For example, a shift worker may need to take a sedating medicine in the morning when working night shifts, and at night, when working day shifts. If the intrusion into life style is too great alternative agents should be considered if they are available. This would include situations such as a lunchtime dose in a school-going child who remains at school for extramural activity and is unlikely to adhere to a three times a day regimen but may very well succeed with a twice daily regimen.</p>\n<h4><strong>Towards concordance when prescribing</strong></h4>\n<p>Establish the patient's:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• occupation,</li>\n<li>• daily routine,</li>\n<li>• recreational activities,</li>\n<li>• past experiences with other medicines, and</li>\n<li>• expectations of therapeutic outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Balance these against the therapeutic alternatives identified based on clinical findings.</p>\n<p>Any clashes between the established routine and life style, with the chosen therapy, should be discussed with the patient in such a manner that the patient will be motivated to change his/her lifestyle",

In the managed healthcare arena in South Africa chronic diseases such as T2DM and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are seen as discrete and are managed independently. In patients with coronary artery disease, identification and treatment of MDD has shown a 42% reduction in death or recurrent myocardial infarction. T2DM patients have an inherently higher cardiovascular risk profile which may suggest a bidirectional relationship between T2DM and MDD. The objective was to examine the hospital admission and length of stay in T2DM and MDD patients within a managed healthcare organization. Methods:</p>\n<p>This study is a retrospective review of claims data of registered T2DM patients at a managed healthcare organization in South Africa for the year 2014. In T2DM patients, comorbidities were defined as concordant such as cardiovascular diseases or discordant i.e. Cancer and MDD. Hospital resource utilization was extracted by number of annual admissions, length of stay and average cost per admission.</p>\n<p>Results:</p>\n<p>Among the 902 registered T2DM patients within the healthcare organization 153 (17%) were identified with having MDD. The T2DM group without MDD was predominantly male (62%) and 58 years old. The group with T2DM and MDD was mainly female (64%) and slightly older at 60",

The T2DM group without MDD was predominantly male (62%) and 58 years old. The group with T2DM and MDD was mainly female (64%) and slightly older at 60 years of age. The T2DM + MDD group revealed an 18% hospital admission rate compared to the T2DM - MDD patients (10%). Hospital patterns of the T2DM and MDD patients are shown in Table 1.</p>\n<p>Conclusions:</p>\n<p>Significantly more patients with MDD and T2DM were hospitalized. There was no difference in the average number of admissions and length of stay in hospital between the T2DM patients with and those without MDD. Preliminary analysis shows no cost difference between the hospitalized T2DM patients with and without MDD. Given the relative incidence of MDD future healthcare initiatives should be aimed at recognizing underlying MDD in patients with T2DM. Healthcare organizations need to focus on combined integrated multiple disease management in T2DM and MDD patients to lower the financial burden and improve outcomes.</p>",
