In the managed healthcare arena in South Africa chronic diseases such as T2DM and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are seen as discrete and are managed independently. In patients with coronary artery disease, identification and treatment of MDD has shown a 42% reduction in death or recurrent myocardial infarction. T2DM patients have an inherently higher cardiovascular risk profile which may suggest a bidirectional relationship between T2DM and MDD. The objective was to examine the hospital admission and length of stay in T2DM and MDD patients within a managed healthcare organization. Methods:</p>\n<p>This study is a retrospective review of claims data of registered T2DM patients at a managed healthcare organization in South Africa for the year 2014. In T2DM patients, comorbidities were defined as concordant such as cardiovascular diseases or discordant i.e. Cancer and MDD. Hospital resource utilization was extracted by number of annual admissions, length of stay and average cost per admission.</p>\n<p>Results:</p>\n<p>Among the 902 registered T2DM patients within the healthcare organization 153 (17%) were identified with having MDD. The T2DM group without MDD was predominantly male (62%) and 58 years old. The group with T2DM and MDD was mainly female (64%) and slightly older at 60", "full_doc_id": "doc-9df3eee697bdb1267ac01d432905579f", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-8fc89353659871857f4a2f36b706fc19", "__created_at__": 1754391356, "content": "and MDD.

The T2DM group without MDD was predominantly male (62%) and 58 years old. The group with T2DM and MDD was mainly female (64%) and slightly older at 60 years of age. The T2DM + MDD group revealed an 18% hospital admission rate compared to the T2DM - MDD patients (10%). Hospital patterns of the T2DM and MDD patients are shown in Table 1.</p>\n<p>Conclusions:</p>\n<p>Significantly more patients with MDD and T2DM were hospitalized. There was no difference in the average number of admissions and length of stay in hospital between the T2DM patients with and those without MDD. Preliminary analysis shows no cost difference between the hospitalized T2DM patients with and without MDD. Given the relative incidence of MDD future healthcare initiatives should be aimed at recognizing underlying MDD in patients with T2DM. Healthcare organizations need to focus on combined integrated multiple disease management in T2DM and MDD patients to lower the financial burden and improve outcomes.</p>", "full_doc_id": "doc-9df3eee697bdb1267ac01d432905579f", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-76dcee1ddb22a2d709c06cd143cc277a", "__created_at__": 1754391356, "content": "<p>Management of</p>\n<h1>type 2 diabetes in adults</h1>\n<h2><em>AT PRIMARY CARE LEVEL - JANUARY 2014</em></h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_0_Picture_3.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>A Long and Healthy Life for All South Africans</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_0_Picture_5.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h1>Foreword by the Minister</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_2_Picture_2.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>Diabetes is a major public health problem. The rising incidence of Diabetes Type 2 is related to the effects of urbanization and unhealthy lifestyles. Research studies show that healthy eating and regular physical activity can prevent or delay the onset of Diabetes Type 2, even in high-risk individuals.</p>\n<p>Early detection and effective management may be associated with a normal lifespan and quality of life. Lifestyle modification, behavioural change, team decision-making and self-care will aid every individual with diabetes to manage his/her condition and prevent deterioration and complications.</p>\n<p>The implementation of this updated guideline, as one of the tools available to manage diabetes, will, with the cooperation of the patients and relevant health professionals, achieve the reduction of complications of diabetes and the reduction of premature mortality from diabetes. The guideline is an integral part of the Diabetes Implementation Strategy for South Africa, which was developed in response to the African Diabetes Declaration and Strategy.</p>\n<p>Health professionals should acquire the relevant knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for successful management of diabetes, so that patients can be empowered with the necessary information and skills. Support from family, friends, community and health professionals is encouraged.</p>\n<p>I would like to thank all the role players who have given many hours of their time to the development of this guideline. This collaborative effort, involving experts in various fields, has resulted in a single guideline being available in South Africa.</p>\n<p>___________________</p>\n<p>Dr A Motsoaledi (MP) Minister of Health</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_2_Picture_10.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h1>Statement by the Deputy Minister</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_3_Picture_1.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>The effective implementation of this diabetes guideline will support the Negotiated Service Delivery Agreement objectives of 'increasing life expectancy' and 'decreasing maternal mortality'.</p>\n<p>This guideline will also support the achievement of some of the ambitious targets that have been set by the department, towards reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases by 2020. These targets arose from the Non-Communicable Diseases Summit held in September 2011.</p>\n<p>Prevention, screening, diagnosis, non-pharmacological and pharmacological management are included, as well as prevention and management of complications and emergencies.</p>\n<p>Persons diagnosed with diabetes, will receive comprehensive diabetes care, and will enter into a partnership with the relevant health professionals so that they may live well and healthy into old age.</p>\n<p>_________________</p>\n<p>Dr G Ramokgopa Deputy Minister: Health</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<h1>Acknowledgements by the Director General</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>It is with very sincere appreciation that I acknowledge, on behalf of the Department of Health, the roles played by the various experts in the development of this collaborative national guideline, Updated Management of type 2 diabetes in Adults at Primary Care Level.</p>\n<p>Particular thanks are due to the members of the SEMDSA Steering Committee and the Advisory Committee, who were representing their respective organisations.

problem, with Type 2 diabetes accounting for more than 90% of diabetes cases. The insidious and initially asymptomatic nature of the disease results in persons not seeking early medical attention, so that 30-85% of cases of type 2 diabetes are undiagnosed. At eventual diagnosis, approximately 20% of patients will have complications of the disease.</p>\n<p>The conservative South African estimate is that 6.5% of adults aged 20-79 years have diabetes. The effects of urbanisation and an unhealthy lifestyle are important contributors to the rising prevalence of obesity and diabetes. The 2003 South Africa Demographic and Health Survey showed that 55% of women and 30% of men, aged 15 years and older, are overweight or obese.</p>\n<p>Effective prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes requires a paradigm shift from a patient-centred approach to a \"whole of government\" and a \"whole of society\" approach. Hence, government departments such as Agriculture, Trade and Industry, Sport and Recreation, Basic Education amongst others, together with non-governmental organizations, need to join forces with Health in preventing and combating diabetes. Collaborating partners must effectively work together at all levels of service delivery.</p>\n<p>It is imperative that focused screening of high-risk persons be introduced, to improve the rate of early detection, thereby reducing late entry - with established long-term complications - into the health system.</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p>Early, good control of glycaemia, blood pressure and dyslipidaemia, together with regular examinations for micro- and macrovascular complications, with appropriate and timely interventions, is the only way to prevent or reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p>Well organized clinics, with staff suitably trained in diabetes care using effective protocols and appropriate tools (SA Diabetes Declaration Implementation Strategy; Long-term care model Implementation Plan; National Guideline: Non-Communicable Diseases: A Strategic Vision, Chronic Diseases Indicators and Records) together with these updated guidelines, will facilitate improved quality of diabetes care. Appropriate monitoring of the application of the available tools, together with effective Clinic management and treatment management, will result in increased numbers of patients with controlled diabetes and a consequent reduction in numbers of complications.</p>\n<p>Many individuals may present with the characteristic symptoms of diabetes (thirst, polyuria (frequent urination), weight loss and blurring of vision) but some individuals, especially older persons, may be asymptomatic. The <strong>acute complications</strong> of diabetes are hypoglycaemia [usually as a complication of therapy] and uncontrolled hyperglycaemia [due to improper management and/or patient non-adherence], whilst the <strong>long-term relatively specific</strong> effects of diabetes include the development of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.</p>\n<p>People with diabetes are also at increased risk of other diseases, including cardiac, peripheral arterial and cerebrovascular disease.</p>\n<p>The metabolic syndrome - abdominal obesity, elevated serum triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol, hypertension, elevated fasting blood glucose level - increases the risk of developing diabetes approximately 5-fold and doubles the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p>Diabetes, regardless of its aetiology, progresses through several clinical stages during its natural history. The spectrum of glucose tolerance extends from normoglycaemia, to intermediate hyperglycaemia (impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) to diabetes.</p>\n<h4><strong>IFG and IGT are high-risk states for developing diabetes.</strong></h4>\n<p>Patient education is imperative - an informed patient can make informed decisions regarding his/her diabetes management and will remind the health professional of the various tests that should be performed during her/his visit to the health facility.</p>\n<p>All health professionals (including Health Promoters and Community Health Workers, lay health workers, and traditional and complementary healers) should promote healthy living and know the common risk factors for developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and cancers; they should also know and recognize the symptoms of diabetes,", "full_doc_id": "doc-80681e8c2fc66feb6c3ece9e9e90db38", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-48019451fb64599a32100497e8728c0d", "__created_at__": 1754391356, "content": "informed patient can make informed decisions regarding his/her diabetes management and will remind the health professional of the various tests that should be performed during her/his visit to the health facility.</p>\n<p>All health professionals (including Health Promoters and Community Health Workers, lay health workers, and traditional and complementary healers) should promote healthy living and know the common risk factors for developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and cancers; they should also know and recognize the symptoms of diabetes, so that suitable referral pathways are established and utilized to achieve early detection and management.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the responsibilities of government, it is extremely important to note that all patients have obligations to themselves, their families and friends, and to the health system in terms of maintaining their health at acceptable levels.

These include processes that impair or destroy the function of the pancreatic beta cells, with consequent <em>insulin deficiency</em>, and others that result in resistance to insulin action (<em>insulin resistance/insulin insensitivity).</em> The abnormalities of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism are due to deficient action of insulin on target tissues resulting from insensitivity or lack of insulin or both.</p>\n<h4><strong>SYMPTOMS of diabetes</strong></h4>\n<p>| Characteristic symptoms: | polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss              |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Other symptoms:          | blurring of vision                             |\n|                          | general body weakness and lethargy             |\n|                          | susceptibility to infections, especially skin, |\n|                          | urogenital tract and respiratory tract         |\n|                          | pruritus vulvae                                |\n|                          | poor wound healing                             |</p>\n<p>Symptoms may not be severe, or may be absent.</p>\n<h4>10<strong>DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES AND OTHER CATEGORIES OF INTERMEDIATE GLYCAEMIA 2,3,4,5,6</strong></h4>\n<p>For clinical purposes, the diagnosis of diabetes should always be confirmed by repeating the same test on another day.</p>\n<p>The diagnosis of diabetes should be based on formal laboratory test results (not point of care tests) prior to the initiation of any therapy.</p>\n<h4><em>Table 1 Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes and categories of intermediate hyperglycaemia</em></h4>\n<p>| Diagnostic test                                                                     | Impaired Fasting Glucose<br>(IFG) | Impaired Glucose<br>Tolerance (IGT) | Diabetes                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Random plasma glucose<br>(RPG) i                                                    | –                                 | –                                   | ≥ 11.1 mmol/L if classic<br>symptoms of diabetes or<br>hyperglycaemic crisisii is<br>present;

Community screening may also be poorly targeted – it may fail to reach groups most at risk and inappropriately test those at low risk or even those already diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Random screening for all adults is not recommended until after the age of 45 years.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, diabetes may be identified in the following instances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• low-risk individuals undergoing incidental glucose testing (random screening) or</li>\n<li>• individuals identified as being at high-risk during routine consultations for unrelated health matters (opportunistic screening)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>or</strong></h4>\n<p>• individuals deliberately identified and tested because of their high-risk status (targeted screening).</p>\n<h4>12<em>Table 3 Criteria for screening for type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic adults</em></h4>\n<p>| At Primary Care Level              |\n|------------------------------------|\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n| Adults                             |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n| tes In                             |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n|                                    |\n| Updated Management Of Type 2 Diabe |</p>\n<p>| Indications | High-risk individuals: All adults, any age, with BMI &gt;

Pharmacological management:</strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>HbA1c &lt; 7% is the primary target for glycaemic control</strong></h4>\n<p>There are 3 main types of hypoglycaemic agents available for use - these are biguanides, sulphonylureas (SU), and insulin.</p>\n<p><em>Biguanides</em>: Metformin is the only product available and is the 'anchor' oral anti-diabetic agent in the management of type 2 diabetes.</p>\n<p>About 30% of users will report gastro-intestinal side-effects, which can be minimised by titrating the dose gradually over one or two months, or by temporarily discontinuing the drug before re-introducing it. When used as monotherapy, metformin can reduce HbA1c by 1 – 2 %.</p>\n<p>In patients with severe renal impairment, adjust metformin dose according to the table below:</p>\n<p>| eGFR                | Action                                                     |  |  |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|\n| &gt; 30 – 60 ml/minute | Continue, use 50% of dose (maximum 500 mg 12 hourly)       |  |  |\n|                     | Increase monitoring of renal function (every 3 – 6 months) |  |  |\n| &lt; 30 ml/minute      | Stop metformin                                             |  |  |</p>\n<p><em>Sulphonylureas</em>: Major adverse effects include hypoglycaemia (the most serious adverse effect) especially in older persons and in the presence of poly-pharmacy and weight gain (average weight gain of 5.3 kg over the first 6 years with most of the weight gain occurring in the first year of treatment). HbA1c reduction ranges from 1.5 – 2 %</p>\n<p><em>Insulin</em>: Patients with type 2 diabetes often require insulin to achieve glycaemic control, thus insulin may be added to other therapies, as second- or third-line therapy.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_19_Picture_13.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h4><strong>STEPS 1 – 3 TO ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE GLYCAEMIC MANAGEMENT</strong></h4>\n<p>All the required tests

doses and injected <strong>before each meal.</strong> This can be done in <strong>one</strong> of the following ways:</li>\n<li>increase the dose of the short acting insulin by <strong>10% of the total daily insulin dose,</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>or</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>increase the usual short acting dose by 20%</li>\n<li>• Do not discontinue the usual insulin doses.</li>\n<li>• Continue oral agents.</li>\n<li>• If vomiting or dehydrated, STOP metformin and seek medical advice or go to the clinic/hospital <strong>urgently</strong>.</li>\n<li>• If patient is vomiting, or if consciousness is impaired, <strong>urgent</strong> assistance should be sought from a doctor, clinic or hospital.</li>\n<li>• If unable to reduce blood glucose levels to resolve the hyperglycaemia,

DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS [DKA]</strong></h4>\n<p>DKA is characterised by uncontrolled hyperglycaemia, metabolic acidosis and increased total body ketones. In South Africa, DKA carries a higher mortality than in the developed world. It can present at any age although it is more common in young patients.</p>\n<p>An acute DKA episode usually develops within 24 hours</p>\n<h4><strong>2. HYPERGLYCAEMIC HYPEROSMOLAR STATE [HHS]</strong></h4>\n<p>Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state is characterised by the slow development of marked hyperglycaemia (usually &gt; 50 mmol/L), hyperosmolality and severe dehydration. Ketonuria may be slight or absent. The condition usually affects middle-aged or older patients and carries a high mortality.</p>\n<p>HHS usually evolves over several days to weeks.</p>\n<h4>28<em>Clinical features</em></h4>\n<p>For both DKA and HHS the classical clinical picture includes a history of</p>\n<p>polyuria,</p>\n<p>polydipsia,</p>\n<p>vomiting,</p>\n<p>dehydration,</p>\n<p>weight loss,</p>\n<p>weakness and</p>\n<p>change in mental status (can vary from mild confusion to profound lethargy or coma, the latter is more common in HHS).</p>\n<p>Focal neurological signs and seizures may occur in HHS.</p>\n<p>Patients with DKA commonly complain of diffuse abdominal pain. Physical findings may include Kussmaul breathing (in DKA only) or shock, with hypotension and tachycardia.</p>\n<p>History taking and examination should not delay the initial investigations, management and referral to hospital.</p>\n<h4><em>Precipitating factors of DKA and HHS</em></h4>\n<p>• Infection is the most common precipitating factor in DKA and HHS.</p>\n<p>Other precipitants include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>discontinuation of insulin,</li>\n<li>myocardial infarction (MI) or</li>\n<li>cerebrovascular accident (CVA).</li>\n<li>• In elderly patients, restricted water intake due to the patient being bedridden can lead to dehydration and precipitate HHS. Drugs such as diuretics may exacerbate the condition.</li>\n<li>• In addition, new-onset diabetes commonly leads to DKA in patients with type 1 diabetes and HHS in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</li>\n<li>• In a significant proportion of patients, no precipitant may be identified.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><em>Treatment of Hyperglycaemic Coma at Primary Care Level</em></h4>\n<h4><strong>Rapid</strong> treatment <strong>and referral</strong> is essential.</h4>\n<p>The following steps should be followed:</p>\n<p>• Confirm diagnosis</p>\n<p>Check capillary glucose and urine ketones to confirm hyperglycaemia and ketonuria.</p>\n<p>Be cautious in renal and cardiac disease.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• In the absence of renal or cardiac compromise, administer intravenous (IV) fluids, starting with normal saline, 15–20 ml/kg in the first hour</li>\n<li>Subsequent infusion rate: 10 ml/kg/hour with 20 ml/kg boluses if shocked.</li>\n<li>Do not exceed 50 ml/kg in the first 4 hours.</li>\n<li>Correct estimated deficits over 24 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the older patient with suspected HHS or cardiac compromise, change to 0.45% saline after the first litre of normal saline.</p>\n<p>• Insulin</p>\n<p>When referral will take more than 2 hours and a diagnosis of diabetes with hyperglycaemia is confirmed, administer short acting insulin, IM, 0.1 unit/kg.</p>\n<p>– When giving insulin IM, do not use insulin needle.</p>\n<h4><strong>CAUTION</strong></h4>\n<p>Do not administer IV short-acting insulin if the serum electrolyte status, especially potassium, is not known.</p>\n<p>Continue with IV fluids but delay giving insulin in these cases in consultation with referral facility as this delay should not negatively influence the patient, but hypokalaemia with resultant cardiac dysrhythmias definitely will.</p>\n<p>See section 8.6.2: Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and Hyperosmolar Nonketotic Diabetic Coma (HONK) of the STG and EML for

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF FOOT PROBLEMS IN DIABETES 37,38,39,40,41,42,43</strong></h4>\n<p>This section aims to highlight the morbidity and mortality associated with distal peripheral sensory diabetic neuropathy and its sequelae, and the measures that should be undertaken to prevent these.</p>\n<p>Ulceration and amputation are preventable complications, and the health care provider should implement the measures outlined here in order to ensure optimal patient outcomes.</p>\n<h4><strong>Defining the problem</strong></h4>\n<p>Foot problems are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes and contribute to increased health care costs.</p>\n<p>In people with neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease, minor trauma to the foot leads to skin ulceration, infection and ultimately gangrene, resulting in amputation. After amputation of one limb, the prognosis for the contra-lateral limb is poor.</p>\n<p>In the North American population foot complications account for 20% of all diabetes-related hospital admissions – unfortunately these data do not exist in South Africa.</p>\n<h4><strong>Risk factors for ulceration.</strong></h4>\n<p>Characteristics that have been shown to confer high risk of ulceration include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• previous ulceration,</li>\n<li>• neuropathy,</li>\n<li>• structural deformity and limited joint mobility,</li>\n<li>• peripheral vascular disease and</li>\n<li>• microvascular complications ie. retinopathy, nephropathy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Understanding how ulcers develop</strong></h4>\n<p>Peripheral sensory neuropathy is present, to some degree, in more than 50% of people with diabetes who are older than 60 years. Peripheral neuropathy must usually be profound before leading to loss of the protective sensation; the consequent vulnerability to physical and thermal trauma increases the risk of foot ulceration 7-fold.</p>\n<p>A second causative factor in foot ulceration is excessive plantar pressure.</p>\n<p>A third component is trauma, particularly when repetitive.</p>\n<p>PAD with obstruction of the arteries to the lower legs and feet also increases the risk of ulceration, and is a crucial factor in the delayed healing of foot ulcers.</p>\n<p>People with PAD may present with symptoms of ischaemia, such as claudication, rest pain, ulceration or gangrene. It is important to remember that people with diabetes often present without any history of these typical symptoms of ischaemia, because most of them also have established peripheral neuropathy.</p>\n<p>PAD in people with diabetes also occurs at an earlier age and progresses more rapidly.</p>\n<h4><strong>Prevention of foot ulceration and amputation</strong></h4>\n<p>A foot examination should be performed on diagnosis of diabetes. The frequency of further foot examinations should be in accordance with the 'risk categorisation system for diabetic feet'. Health care professionals trained in the assessment of feet should examine the patient's feet to detect risk factors for ulceration.</p>\n<p>Foot assessment forms should be available and should include foot history and results of the foot examination.</p>\n<h4><strong>REFER: Annexure C1</strong></h4>\n<p>Effective foot care involves a partnership between the patient and/or family member/care giver and the health care personnel, who will provide the relevant foot care advice.

However, significant disparities exist between different population groups with regard to the prevalence of diabetes.</p>\n<p>| People of Asian/Indian descent: | 17.1% prevalence                                                                |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                 | At risk from a younger age (+ 10 years earlier than other<br>population groups) |\n| Urbanised Black people:         | 6.4% prevalence                                                                 |\n|                                 | Urbanised black females &gt; 60 years at particular risk                           |\n| White and Coloured people:      | 6.2% prevalence                                                                 |\n|                                 | Coloured people &gt; 60 years at particular risk, more so females                  |</p>\n<p>It is apparent from South African anthropometric data that there is a correlation between obesity and diabetes among Coloured and African females.</p>\n<p>The obesity prevalence in Coloured women was 26.3%, in African women 31.8% and White women 21.1%.</p>\n<p>For people of Asian/Indian descent, a poor correlation between obesity and diabetes has been noted at the same BMI cut-off values. For this reason, the WHO recommends the use of lower BMI levels when managing these patients. These patients will be considered 'at risk' at a BMI of 22-25 kg/m2 , and at 'higher risk' with a BMI ≥ 26 kg/m2 . A smaller waist circumference should also be used to determine risk (women ≥ 80 cm and men ≥ 90 cm)</p>\n<h4>48<strong>Recommendations</strong></h4>\n<p>Individuals of Asian/Indian descent should be screened for type 2 diabetes from age 30, using the lower BMI and waist circumference thresholds.</p>\n<p>Coloured individuals and Black females should be screened from the age of 40, particularly if the BMI is raised.</p>\n<p>Health Care Providers dealing with high-risk groups should be aware of increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and should be vigilant for the development of micro- and macrovascular complications.</p>\n<h2><strong>D5. HIV AND DIABETES</strong></h2>\n<p>South Africa, with an estimated population of 50 million people, has about 5.6 million people living with HIV. Approximately 1.4 million are on HAART and this number is expected to increase since the CD4 cut off point was increased to 350 cells/mm3 .</p>\n<p>As patients on HAART live longer due to a decline in the acute manifestations of HIV, there is, however, a definite increase in the chronic metabolic complications. These complications are mainly iatrogenic (related to HAART) and partly related to HIV itself, and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• dysglycaemia and insulin resistance</li>\n<li>• dyslipidaemia</li>\n<li>• lipodystrophy</li>\n<li>• accelerated atherosclerosis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The incidence of diabetes mellitus is increasing in the HIV population on ARVs, and these patients therefore need to be screened regularly for signs of diabetes.</p>\n<p>The current estimate is", "full_doc_id": "doc-80681e8c2fc66feb6c3ece9e9e90db38", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-868ccb5351320321cda28e935f38e86b", "__created_at__": 1754391356, "content": "HAART) and partly related to HIV itself, and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• dysglycaemia and insulin resistance</li>\n<li>• dyslipidaemia</li>\n<li>• lipodystrophy</li>\n<li>• accelerated atherosclerosis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The incidence of diabetes mellitus is increasing in the HIV population on ARVs, and these patients therefore need to be screened regularly for signs of diabetes.</p>\n<p>The current estimate is that about 2.6% of patients have both diabetes and HIV.</p>\n<h4><strong>Risk Factors for HIV+ persons developing diabetes</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Classic diabetes mellitus risk factors</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Human Immunodeficiency Virus itself: viral load, CD4 count, and duration of disease.

HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS - PREVENTION AND DELAY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES 57,58,59,60,61,62</strong></h2>\n<p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is rapidly rising. Treatment has been a serious challenge and, despite the availability of numerous medications, control remains suboptimal. A practical approach to addressing the rising tide of diabetes is to shift the attention to prevention, or delaying onset.</p>\n<p>Diabetes is a pandemic associated with significant morbidity and mortality.</p>\n<p>Early detection of those at risk for developing diabetes, and early intervention strategies, can prevent the progression of intermediate hyperglycaemia to diabetes and its associated complications.</p>\n<h4><strong>High risk individuals include</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>• those with a family history of type 2 diabetes</li>\n<li>• those belonging to high-risk ethnic groups</li>\n<li>• the obese (BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 )</li>\n<li>• those with increased waist circumference (&gt; 94 cm in men; &gt; 80 cm in women)</li>\n<li>• those with a history of gestational diabetes</li>\n<li>• those with at least one component of the metabolic syndrome</li>\n<li>• those with cardiovascular disease</li>\n<li>• those with polycystic ovarian syndrome</li>\n<li>• those with IGT or IFG</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patients with high-risk \"pre-diabetic\" conditions like IGT and IFG have a 25 – 50% lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and should be targeted for primary prevention. To this end, a number of well-designed intervention studies have been conducted, which variously show reductions in the development of diabetes ranging from 31–46% up to 58%.</p>\n<p>It has been conclusively shown that changes in the diet to promote moderate weight loss, and increased levels of physical activity, can prevent the development of diabetes in people with <em>impaired glucose tolerance</em> (IGT) and <em>impaired fasting glucose</em> (IFG).</p>\n<p>Persons with IGT or IFG together with a high-risk profile, or persons who fail to control with lifestyle modifications, could benefit from the addition of metformin.</p>\n<h4><strong>Recommendation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes</strong></h4>\n<p>Lifestyle modification including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• low calorie, low-refined carbohydrate, low-saturated fat, low salt</li>\n<li>• regular exercise comprising sustained, moderate-intensity physical activity for a minimum period of 150 minutes/ week</li>\n<li>• 5% 10% reduction in body weight (where relevant)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Drugs for the prevention of type 2 diabetes</strong></h4>\n<p>Metformin is recommended by the American Diabetes Association for use in patients who are grossly overweight (BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 ) and younger than 60 years, and have a family history of diabetes and have hypertension, a poor lipid profile and HbA1c &gt;6%.</p>\n<p>The suggested dose: 850mg metformin twice daily</p>\n<p>Problems associated with recommending drugs for the prevention of diabetes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• How long should the patients stay on the drugs?</li>\n<li>• Will the drugs alter or reverse the disease in the longer term?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The recommended therapy should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• be safe in the long-term</li>\n<li>• be effective</li>\n<li>• be cheap</li>\n<li>• show other health benefits (e.g. cardiac disease prevention)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Metformin has shown preventive potential, although at lesser efficacy.

Additionally, \"sudden attacks of disabling giddiness or fainting\" and \"defective vision\" could be relevant exclusion conditions for a patient with diabetes.</p>\n<p>The Act currently puts the burden of proof on the individual, who should \"within a period of 21 days after having so become aware of the disqualification submit the licence to the MEC of the Province\". There is currently no legal requirement for a healthcare worker to report patients deemed unfit to drive.</p>\n<p>Unlike in many other countries (Europe and America), there is currently no separate legislation for drivers of commercial vehicles. Since commercial vehicle drivers drive for longer periods, at faster speeds and on the highways more than average private drivers, and since commercial vehicles are larger and potentially more lethal than private motor vehicles, and may be involved in public transportation (buses; mini-bus taxis) the potential for severe and disastrous traffic accidents is clearly of additional concern.</p>\n<h4>54<strong>• Risks of diabetes and driving</strong></h4>\n<p>There is no strong epidemiological data that suggest an increase in traffic accidents among people with diabetes. A meta-analysis of 15 studies suggested that the relative risk of having a motor vehicle accident for people with diabetes as a whole (without differentiating those with a significant risk from those with little or no risk) as compared with the general population, ranges between 1.126 and 1.19, a 12-19% increased risk.</p>\n<p>Society tolerates much higher relative risks associated with a variety of other situations (such a sleep apnoea, the very young driver (s) with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder).</p>\n<p>It would thus be unjustified to restrict driving privileges of an entire class of individuals, such as drivers with diabetes.</p>\n<p>The most significant subgroup of persons with diabetes, for whom a greater degree of restrictions is often applied across the rest of the world, is drivers managing their diabetes with insulin. Insulin therapy <em>per se</em> has not been found to be associated with increased driving risk. The single most significant factor in collisions involving drivers with diabetes, appears to be a recent history of severe hypoglycaemia (regardless of diabetes type or treatment used).</p>\n<h4><strong>• Recommendations for the South African situation</strong></h4>\n<p>Generally, fitness to drive should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and should be based on concrete evidence of actual risk.</p>\n<p>Healthcare professionals should be knowledgeable and regularly discuss ways to reduce the risks of driving with their patients who have diabetes.</p>\n<p>Persons with diabetes should take an active role in assessing their ability to drive and in obtaining information about the recognition, treatment and avoidance of hypoglycaemia.</p>\n<p>Adeguate blood glucose test strips should be provided to persons with diabetes who drive, to cover additional testing before and during driving periods, if necessary.</p>\n<h4><strong>Private vehicles</strong></h4>\n<p>Irrespective of treatment regimen or diabetes type, persons with diabetes should have no restrictions in general, provided:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• He/she has regular medical supervision with a minimum of 2 clinic visits per year</li>\n<li>• High-risk patients are offered targeted education and advice</li>\n<li>• Patients who have experienced severe hypoglycaemic events or hypoglycaemic unawareness, have consulted their healthcare providers to determine whether it is safe to drive and to target interventions to avoid further episodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Commercial vehicles</strong></h4>\n<p>The South African law should provide clear guidance for annual assessment and clear criteria for holding a commercial licence.</p>\n<p>Candidates with diabetes who apply for commercial licences should have an initial full medical assessment, with annual reassessments by a specialist physician, endocrinologist or family physician trained in diabetes management, including a review of medical records and glucometer readings of the previous 24 months.</p>\n<p>The following standards should apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• No severe hypoglycaemic event (requiring assistance from another person) has occurred in the previous 6 months</li>\n<li>• The driver has full hypoglycaemic awareness</li>\n<li>\n<p>• The driver shows adequate control of his/her condition with regular blood glucose monitoring at least twice daily, and at times relevant to driving</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>• The driver demonstrates an understanding of the risks of hypoglycaemia</p>\n</li>\n<li>• None of the following potentially dangerous complications or co-morbidities associated with diabetes are present:</li>\n<li>Sight-threatening retinopathy or cataracts (a full eye examination by", "full_doc_id": "doc-80681e8c2fc66feb6c3ece9e9e90db38", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-b752ce36b859046d9641b5096d445e7c", "__created_at__": 1754391356, "content": "<li>\n<p>• The driver shows adequate control of his/her condition with regular blood glucose monitoring at least twice daily, and at times relevant to driving</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>• The driver demonstrates an understanding of the risks of hypoglycaemia</p>\n</li>\n<li>• None of the following potentially dangerous complications or co-morbidities associated with diabetes are present:</li>\n<li>Sight-threatening retinopathy or cataracts (a full eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist is mandatory)</li>\n<li>Obstructive sleep apnoea</li>\n<li>Unstable coronary artery disease or arrhythmias</li>\n<li>Transient ischaemic attacks</li>\n<li>Significant neurological deficits (cerebrovascular disease, peripheral or autonomic neuropathy)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Patient education</strong></h4>\n<p>Ideally, drivers at risk of hypoglycaemia should measure their blood glucose level before and at least every four hours, during a long drive.</p>\n<h4>They <strong>should not drive</strong> when their blood glucose is <strong>&lt; 4.0 mmol/L</strong></h4>\n<p>Drivers should stop, test and treat themselves as soon as hypoglycaemia and/or impaired driving is suspected.</p>\n<p>They <strong>should not drive for 45-60 minutes</strong> after effective treatment of non-severe hypoglycaemia (not requiring assistance).</p>\n<p>Drivers, whose HbA1c may currently be in the normal range, <strong>but who have a history of severe hypoglycaemia during the last year, or who have hypoglycaemic unawareness, or who have had a recent marked fall in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c),</strong> should be informed that they are at high risk of hypoglycaemia when driving, and should make every effort to minimise that risk, particularly by closely monitoring their blood glucose.</p>\n<p>Employers should be informed of this risk.</p>\n<h4><strong>D9.

PERIODONTAL (GUM) DISEASE AND DIABETES</strong></h4>\n<p>Research proved a significant relevance between diabetes and periodontal disease.</p>\n<h4><strong>Periodontal disease consists of:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>• <em>Gingivitis</em>caused by plaque which collects around the neck of teeth. Inflammation is present and the gingiva bleeds easily, and is red and swollen. Gingivitis is reversible if good oral hygiene practices are <strong>timely</strong> implemented. Refer patient to an oral hygienist.</li>\n<li>• <em>Periondontitis</em>inflammation surrounding the tooth root. It is when the periodontal ligament [which connects the tooth root to alveolar (tooth socket) bone] is destroyed.

These patients would require rehabilitation services.</p>\n<p>Rehabilitation services must occur within a multidisciplinary approach. A variety of professional staff should contribute to the overall management of the patient, with the patient and family member and/or caregiver being integral to the effective functioning of the multidisciplinary team. The family member/caregiver should be involved throughout the rehabilitation process.</p>\n<p>A patient/client who requires rehabilitation should be identified and referred early in order to derive maximum benefit from therapeutic interventions. Early intervention is also important in preventing complications that might arise as a result of disuse or wrong use of certain parts of the body.</p>\n<p>Rehabilitation will focus on empowering patients through detailed rehabilitation plans, home programmes as well as the provision of technical aids and devices (e.g. wheelchairs, low vision aids, white canes) when required.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"_page_58_Picture_1.jpeg\" /></p>\n<h1>REFERENCES</h1>\n<p>The development of this guideline was a collaborative effort between the members of the SEMDSA Steering Committee and the Advisory Committee, of which the Department of Health was a member.</p>\n<p>A complete list of references is available in the publication \"The 2012 SEMDSA Guideline for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes\" in JEMDSA 2012;17 (1) S1-S94.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>International Diabetes Federation.IDF Diabetes Atlas c 2003 (cited 2012 March 18) Available from: http: //www.idf.org/ diabetesatlas.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Alberti KG, Zimmet PZ.

Never cut down the corners of the toenails as this may cause ingrown toenails. If the toenails cannot be cut, file them downwards. If your vision is impaired, ask someone to do this for you.</li>\n<li>• Sharp instruments must never be used to dig around toenails.</li>\n<li>• Never cut corns or calluses yourself or use corn plasters, other chemicals or other remedies. These preparations are acidic and often cause ulcers. Consult a health-care professional. Corns and calluses are an indication of a problem.</li>\n<li>• Avoid anything that restricts the blood flow to your feet. Never wear garters or socks with tight elastic tops.</li>\n<li>• Stop/reduce smoking as this adversely affects circulation.</li>\n<li>• During cold weather, always remove all heating mechanisms (like heater, hot water bottle) BEFORE getting into bed.</li>\n<li>• Remember to test the temperature of bath water before getting in. If unable to do so, let someone else test it. Avoid using very hot water when bathing.</li>\n<li>• Proper footwear is very important for the older person.

This explains why the level of HbA1c can increase or decrease relatively quickly with large changes in glucose.</p>\n<p>HbA1c is a useful tool for guiding therapy and predicting outcomes.</p>\n<h1>ANNEXURE F</h1>\n<h2><strong>A GUIDE TO PATIENT ADHERENCE IN CHRONIC CONDITIONS</strong></h2>\n<p>Achieving health goals for chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, HIV and AIDS, epilepsy, hypertension, mental health disorders and TB requires attention to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• Adherence to long term pharmacotherapy incomplete or non-adherence can lead to failure of an otherwise sound pharmacotherapeutic regimen.</li>\n<li>• Organization of health care services, which includes consideration of access to medicines and continuity of care</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Patient Adherence</strong></h4>\n<p>Adherence is the extent to which a person's behaviour – taking medication, following a diet and/or executing lifestyle changes - corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider.</p>\n<p>Poor adherence results in less than optimal management and control of the illness and is often the primary reason for suboptimal clinical benefit.

The successful integration of the regimen is informed by the extent to which the regimen differs from his or her established daily routine. Where the pharmacological proprieties of the medication permits it, the pharmacotherapy dosing regimen should be adapted to the patient's daily routine. For example, a shift worker may need to take a sedating medicine in the morning when working night shifts, and at night, when working day shifts. If the intrusion into life style is too great alternative agents should be considered if they are available. This would include situations such as a lunchtime dose in a school-going child who remains at school for extramural activity and is unlikely to adhere to a three times a day regimen but may very well succeed with a twice daily regimen.</p>\n<h4><strong>Towards concordance when prescribing</strong></h4>\n<p>Establish the patient's:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>• occupation,</li>\n<li>• daily routine,</li>\n<li>• recreational activities,</li>\n<li>• past experiences with other medicines, and</li>\n<li>• expectations of therapeutic outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Balance these against the therapeutic alternatives identified based on clinical findings.</p>\n<p>Any clashes between the established routine and life style, with the chosen therapy, should be discussed with the patient in such a manner that the patient will be motivated to change his/her lifestyle", "full_doc_id": "doc-80681e8c2fc66feb6c3ece9e9e90db38", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e8553409de2918effb9c98baee2c387e", "__created_at__": 1754391356, "content": "li>\n<li>• daily routine,</li>\n<li>• recreational activities,</li>\n<li>• past experiences with other medicines, and</li>\n<li>• expectations of therapeutic outcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Balance these against the therapeutic alternatives identified based on clinical findings.</p>\n<p>Any clashes between the established routine and life style, with the chosen therapy, should be discussed with the patient in such a manner that the patient will be motivated to change his/her lifestyle.</p>\n<h4><strong>Note:</strong></h4>\n<p>Education that focuses on these identified problems is more likely to be successful than a generic approach toward the condition/medicine.</p>\n<h4><strong>Education points to consider</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>• Focus on the positive aspects of therapy whilst being encouraging regarding the impact of the negative aspects and offer support to deal with them if they occur.</li>\n<li>• Provide realistic expectations regarding:</li>\n<li>normal progression of the illness especially important in those diseases where therapy merely controls the progression and those that are asymptomatic;</li>\n<li>the improvement that therapy and non-drug treatment can add to the quality of life.</li>\n<li>• Establish therapeutic goals and discuss them openly with the patient.</li>\n<li>• Any action to be taken with loss of control or when side effects develop.</li>\n<li>• In conditions that are asymptomatic or where symptoms have been controlled, reassure the patient that this reflects therapeutic success, and not that the condition has resolved.</li>\n<li>• Where a patient raises concern regarding anticipated side effects, attempt to place this in the correct context with respect to incidence, the risks vs. the benefits, and whether or not the side effects will disappear after continued use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Note</strong></h4>\n<p>Some patient's lifestyles make certain adverse responses acceptable which others may find intolerable. Sedation is unlikely to be acceptable to a student but an older patient with insomnia may welcome this side effect. This is where concordance plays a vital role.</p>\n<h4><strong>Notes on prescribing in chronic conditions.</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>• Don't change doses without good reason.</li>\n<li>• Never blame anyone or anything for non-adherence before fully investigating the cause.</li>\n<li>• If the clinical outcome is unsatisfactory investigate adherence (remember side effects may be a problem here).</li>\n<li>• Always consider possible side effects and screen for these side effects from time to time.</li>\n<li>\n<p>• When prescribing a new medicine for an additional health-related problem ask yourself whether or not this medicine is being used to manage a side effect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>74• Adherence with a once daily dose is best. Twice daily regimens show agreeable adherence. However, three times a day regimens show a sharp drop in adherence with poor adherence to 4 times a day regimens.</p>\n</li>\n<li>• Keep the total number of tablets to an absolute minimum too many may lead to medication dosing errors and may influence adherence</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Improving Continuity of Therapy</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>• Make clear and concise records.</li>\n<li>• Involve the patient in the care plan.</li>\n<li>• Every patient on chronic therapy should know:</li>\n<li>his/her diagnosis</li>\n<li>the name of every medicine</li>\n<li>the dose and interval of the regimen</li>\n<li>his/her BP or other readings</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>Note: The prescriber should reinforce this only once management of the condition has been established.</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>• When the patient seeks medical attention for any other complaints such as a cold or headache he/she must inform that person about any other condition/disease and its management</li>\n<li>• If a patient indicates that he/she is unable to comply with a prescribed regimen, consider an alternative not to treat might be one option, but be aware of the
