It was something so ephemeral that it seemed to have lost its meaning. It was unlikely that one of the children would somehow become infected with the virus. Life with the Bishop was simple: mornings with prayers and a plate of fried bananas; afternoons with Jesus and rosaries and seashells; evenings with stories and hymns. There was no way a child living with Bishop would end up being contaminated with the virus of depression.\n\n\n\nThe children had only heard about the word once whilst listening to a discussion they never should have. The Bishop, of course, chastised them by letting them sit in the sun for hours. Afterward, one of the women who wore white and accompanied the Bishop to church on Thursdays came and sat the children on the steps that led to the creek, wanting to explain what the word meant.\n\nShe said, “One shouldn’t eavesdrop on adult conversations again. The Lord hates it.”\n\n\n\nTwo children sat by her side, one on her right and the other on her left. Two others sat on the lower steps, straining their heads backward to catch her words. She was not being loud. It was as though she was talking in low voice for a purpose. They were four children who did not know why they could not dance in the rain or dig holes for dead butterflies. Still, they listened to the woman in white. \n\n\n\n“What is depression then?” one of the children asked. She was ten, would be eleven in a week yet she had no name. Bishop did not give his children names. He called them by their ages. In a week, she would be called eleven, replaced by the number she’d come to love and own.\n\nThe woman answered, “It is just something that shouldn’t be talked about. It’s a virus, something that contaminates the soul.”\n\n“We don’t have it, do we?” thirteen asked. She still had a couple of months before her name would change but she was not wise. She only knew what she was told.\n\n“No, no,” the woman said.\n\n“How would we know if we have it?” seven asked. “What would papa do if we had it?”\n\nThe woman straightened. “Dear, dear, none of you could ever have it, understand? Now forget there ever was a word like that.”\n\n\n\nOnly one of the children said nothing –a boy with dark hair and golden eyes—scrunching at the sun and the water, imagining there was a life afterward; something that was accurate and real and not halved by nothingness. He was the older child, fifteen, calm, quiet, solid and he knew nothing. He sat on the steps for hours until his name became an anthem. They were calling out to him for dinner and stories.\n\n\n\nWhen he climbed back to the house, Bishop asked him to wash his hands twice and recite the Lord’s Prayer. The boy missed three lines because, as he would later say, he was nervous. He did not eat dinner that night nor breakfast the next morning. It was to be his punishment. Ten stole flatbread and beans and met him by the creek. She told him to eat it quickly lest the Bishop caught her. They sometimes forgot he was their father. \n\n\n\nFifteen ate the food and gave her a small hug. “Thank you,” he told her. She smiled quickly and ran back to the house. The boy sat by the water until the sun was touching the tip of his fingers only. Bishop asked him to recite it again. This time, the boy made no mistake and he ate his dinner in peace.\n\n\n\nA relationship so dreadfully insincere had formed between the Bishop and the children but none was willing to tell. They would meet outside the church, standing close to the caramel columns, and laugh about the poise and dexterity of the choristers; twirling in the cold, unattainable bits of blinding knowledge. Then, they would run down the streets with their hands above their heads and color their faces with the spangled air of the streets. The sidewalks were controlled; pedestrians were half-running, half-walking, going to meet their futures. \n\nTen stopped suddenly to look around.\n\n\n\nIt was sometime later before the boy realized his sister had stopped. He led the other two back to where Ten now sat, covered in afternoon tears.\n\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” she said.\n\nThe boy smiled at her, his looks resembling pity for both her and himself. She smiled back even though she was still crying and followed him.\n\n\n\nThe two girls stayed at the front, walking with ease down to their safe spot. The boy held his favorite sister by her hands, noting how skinny her wrists were. He told her, said she was a little too skinny and she laughed and she said she wasn’t, arguing about something that would outlive the moment. They turned away from the street that led to the church and instead of following the path that led home, they turned away in the opposite direction because, frankly, home was the water as the sun danced naked in it. \n\n\n\n“Why did you stop?” he asked her suddenly. \n\n“I don’t know,” she said and sniffed. She was not crying but there was a jagged white line across her cheeks; tears dried so quickly the boy mistook it as the grace of framed happiness. \n\nHe nodded, “Did you know that every stranger has a life as simple and complex as yours and mine?”\n\nTen frowned, asked, “How do you know that?”\n\n\n\nThe children of Bishop were not allowed to know things that were not framed by the women in white or by Bishop himself. If her brother knew these things, it meant he had slipped into the library in town and had taken a book secretly. Bishop did not\n######################\nOutput:",

If her brother knew these things, it meant he had slipped into the library in town and had taken a book secretly. Bishop did not like that.\n\n“Well, it depends on how we view things and how we react to those things,” he said. He was paraphrasing but the idea was the same. “If we were to look at others in the same way as we view ourselves, we’d be able to understand it all.”\n\n“I don’t understand,” she said to him. \n\nHe nodded. Finally, they were home.\n\n\n\nThe water was plain and still and naked. The sun was low in the sky, the wind throwing a vortex of grasses and dewdrops. All four of them sat on the steps saying nothing. It was not all the time they were allowed happiness in the form of dancing sunlight and the sweet smell of clean water. \n\n“Tell us a story, Fifteen,” they said, shuffling their foot. Ten had curly hair so as she did that, they fell against her eyes. She blew air and laughed because she found quiet humor in the messiness. The other girls had straight hair like their mothers. Only the boy had a faint memory of her as he had told them before.\n\n\n\n“She went to help people in the other side of the world,” he had said to him. She had left them but perhaps it was because of Bishop and his stringent rules that had caused her departure. The boy had a vague memory of her face as she kissed his cheeks. He did not know her that well.\n\n\n\nThe others had simply forgotten about her. She was easy to forget because she did not call or write or say something to them. He remembered her only because he wanted to have something, anything, that was not one-sided.\n\n\n\n“I don’t have a story today,” he said, standing up. “But I want us to talk.”\n\nThe girls shook their heads.\n\nHe asked them, “What do you want when you grow up?”\n\n\n\nTen told him to start because she wanted to hear something dreamy, something tainted with the desire to become better.\n\n“I imagine I’m all grown up and married,” he started. “My wife might be a teacher or a librarian. I’ll have two daughters.”\n\n“What about me?” Seven asked, smiling shyly. \n\n“I imagine you working in a coffee shop, smiling at strangers with messy hair,” he said.\n\nShe thought about it for a while and then shook her head. “What is coffee?”\n\nAnd because the boy had only read about it, he said nothing.\n\nThirteen said, “I think I might become a chorister when I grow.”\n\n\n\nThe boy wanted to ask her why but chose not to. It was the sort of future she envisioned so he let her daydream about wearing white and golden robes and singing songs and hymns. He had never heard her sing but, of course, she would be exceptional.\n\nIt was Ten’s turn. “I think I might become a mother when I grow up.”\n\n\n\nA shimmer of rain began to fall and the children dashed back home. It was evening or maybe almost. For dinner, there was a bowl of spaghetti and mint sauce. Then, they crept into their rooms. The three girls slept together in a large room where the stars were in awkward shapes, designed lightly over the walls. They slept in separate beds and dreamt separately but they lived together in simple lucidity.\n\n\n\nThe boy lived in the room two doors away. The room was small and had a single window and bars as though the Bishop believed he would someday run away. The bed was neat with two pillows. The lamplight reeked of still melancholy, the sort of feeling one might get from being lonely all of a sudden. In the bathroom, there was a single bar of Palmolive soap and a mirror broken at the sides like the claws of a witch. Fifteen fell asleep sometime around midnight although he swore he heard footsteps go past his door.\n\n\n\nBishop came to wake him up. “Get up, boy,” he said, “Where is Ten?”\n\nFifteen struggled on his feet and followed the grey-haired man out of the room. Ten’s bed was made, the pillow in neat positions. A corner of it was dipped, the sheets squeezed, a timely reminder that she had slept on the bed.\n\n\n\nOne of the women in white took the two girls into the painting room where she told them to carve out words. “Tell me where Ten is,” she said to them.\n\n“We don’t know,” they said, “She was gone when we woke up.”\n\n\n\nBishop took the boy out of the house.\n\nThe sun was out fully, the birds were singing beautifully. It was a graceful day. \n\n“Where do you think she might be?” Bishop asked, “Once I find her, I’m going to give her a good spanking.”\n\nIt was morning so they had the upper hand. Fifteen took the Bishop to the creek. It was quiet and undisturbed. They went through the town and they called her name and they strained their eyes against the sun. They met with scrofulous town’s men and they asked about her. By evening, Fifteen had grown scared. The Bishop went into his room to pray while the girls went to theirs to sleep. The third bed by the window remained empty for the night.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Bishop went into town to talk to the police. Two men followed him back and questioned the girls.\n\n“I was sleeping,” Seven said, her lips shaking, her visions becoming blurry and\n######################\nOutput:",

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nTHIS IS THE DAY WE DIE\\n\\n\\n\\nDepression sounded like a half-witted song, one that couldn’t be sung at home or school or the church. It was something so ephemeral that it seemed to have lost its meaning. It was unlikely that one of the children would somehow become infected with the virus. Life with the Bishop was simple: mornings with prayers and a plate of fried bananas; afternoons with Jesus and rosaries and seashells; evenings with stories and hymns. There was no way a child living with Bishop would end up being contaminated with the virus of depression.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe children had only heard about the word once whilst listening to a discussion they never should have. The Bishop, of course, chastised them by letting them sit in the sun for hours. Afterward, one of the women who wore white and accompanied the Bishop to church on Thursdays came and sat the children on the steps that led to the creek, wanting to explain what the word meant.\\n\\nShe said, “One shouldn’t eavesdrop on adult conversations again. The Lord hates it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo children sat by her side, one on her right and the other on her left. Two others sat on the lower steps, straining their heads backward to catch her words. She was not being loud. It was as though she was talking in low voice for a purpose. They were four children who did not know why they could not dance in the rain or dig holes for dead butterflies. Still, they listened to the woman in white. \\n\\n\\n\\n“What is depression then?” one of the children asked. She was ten, would be eleven in a week yet she had no name. Bishop did not give his children names. He called them by their ages. In a week, she would be called eleven, replaced by the number she’d come to love and own.\\n\\nThe woman answered, “It is just something that shouldn’t be talked about. It’s a virus, something that contaminates the soul.”\\n\\n“We don’t have it, do we?” thirteen asked. She still had a couple of months before her name would change but she was not wise. She only knew what she was told.\\n\\n“No, no,” the woman said.\\n\\n“How would we know if we have it?” seven asked. “What would papa do if we had it?”\\n\\nThe woman straightened. “Dear, dear, none of you could ever have it, understand? Now forget there ever was a word like that.”\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly one of the children said nothing –a boy with dark hair and golden eyes—scrunching at the sun and the water, imagining there was a life afterward; something that was accurate and real and not halved by nothingness. He was the older child, fifteen, calm, quiet, solid and he knew nothing. He sat on the steps for hours until his name became an anthem. They were calling out to him for dinner and stories.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen he climbed back to the house, Bishop asked him to wash his hands twice and recite the Lord’s Prayer. The boy missed three lines because, as he would later say, he was nervous. He did not eat dinner that night nor breakfast the next morning. It was to be his punishment. Ten stole flatbread and beans and met him by the creek. She told him to eat it quickly lest the Bishop caught her. They sometimes forgot he was their father. \\n\\n\\n\\nFifteen ate the food and gave her a small hug. “Thank you,” he told her. She smiled quickly and ran back to the house. The boy sat by the water until the sun was touching the tip of his fingers only. Bishop asked him to recite it again. This time, the boy made no mistake and he ate his dinner in peace.\\n\\n\\n\\nA relationship so dreadfully insincere had formed between the Bishop and the children but none was willing to tell. They would meet outside the church, standing close to the caramel columns, and laugh about the poise and dexterity of the choristers; twirling in the cold, unattainable bits of blinding knowledge. Then, they would run down the streets with their hands above their heads and color their faces with the spangled air of the streets. The sidewalks were controlled; pedestrians were half-running, half-walking, going to meet their futures. \\n\\nTen stopped suddenly to look around.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was sometime later before the boy realized his sister had stopped. He led the other two back to where Ten now sat, covered in afternoon tears.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” she said.\\n\\nThe boy smiled at her, his looks resembling pity for both her and himself. She smiled back even though she was still crying and followed him.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two girls stayed at the front, walking with ease down to their safe spot. The boy held his favorite sister by her hands, noting how skinny her wrists were. He told her, said she was a little too skinny and she laughed and she said she wasn’t, arguing about something that would outlive the moment. They turned away from the street that led to the church and instead of following the path that led home, they turned away in the opposite direction because, frankly, home was the water as the sun danced naked in it. \\n\\n\\n\\n“Why did you stop?” he asked her suddenly. \\n\\n“I don’t know,” she said and sniffed. She was not crying but there was a jagged white line across her cheeks; tears dried so quickly the boy mistook it as the grace of framed happiness. \\n\\nHe nodded, “Did you know that every stranger has a life as simple and complex as yours and mine?”\\n\\nTen frowned, asked, “How do you know that?”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe children of Bishop were not allowed to know things that were not framed by the women in white or by Bishop himself.

They met with scrofulous town’s men and they asked about her. By evening, Fifteen had grown scared. The Bishop went into his room to pray while the girls went to theirs to sleep. The third bed by the window remained empty for the night.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Bishop went into town to talk to the police. Two men followed him back and questioned the girls.\n\n“I was sleeping,” Seven said, her lips shaking, her visions becoming blurry and wet.\n\n“We talked before we fell asleep,” Thirteen said.\n\nFifteen gulped and sniffed and said he had heard footsteps go past his door by midnight.\n\n“It could have been the girl,” one of the policemen said.\n\n“She would not go out that late,” Bishop said.\n\n“And yet she is missing.”\n\n\n\nThe sarcasm was great and treacherous so much that Bishop pulled back and shivered. It would be the first time the boy was to see his father like this.\n\n“Has she ever done something like this before?”\n\n“No,” said Bishop tentatively.\n\n“We’ll search for her,” the second man said. “If she shows up, let us know.”\n\n\n\nShe did not show up that day.\n\n\n\nFifteen was troubled but more than that, he knew that he was lacking something and that he was living in the same knowledge everyone had. He searched the girls’ room, turning the sheets out, throwing the pillows aside until his heart ached. And he was searching like a mad man for a sign that could lead him to his sister. He turned the events of that day at the creek in his head. She knew nothing, would not leave the house unless he took her. Yet she was gone, disappearing like her existence was nothing, without a trace. In fact, she seemed like something he had made up in his mind.\n\n\n\nSearching for a sign—any kind— steered him to make the greatest discovery ever: scratch marks on the floor by her bed. They were small marks, easily forgotten but the boy had held her hands. He knew her and perhaps, yes, this was the sign he’d been waiting for.\n\n\n\nOr perhaps not. The marks had been made by Seven some time ago so that ruled everything out. By the ruling out of things, it meant that there was no single idea as to where she was. And yes, Ten stopped being Ten because a week had passed and her birthday too. The idea that she had left so suddenly or be taken away ripped the boy’s heart. The Bishop retreated steadily to his room and his hymns and the sun shone and the birds sang and the water flowed.\n\n\n\nIt was a month later, after the boy had waited and prayed for a sign, that he knew, somehow, he had caught the virus. He would find himself plunging into an abyss, untethered, dead and he would not know how to breathe or what to do or what to say. It was a punch to his guts, the falling of everything that used to keep him in place because he had loved his sister in that delicate way of loving something one couldn’t touch, swaying in the tainted and staggering approach of the sun and the moon and the stars. And because he had gotten a version of her and her messy hair and childish candidness, he knew he had not made her up.\n\n\n\nHe found himself under the water of the bathtub, sinking and unable to breathe, dying. And something or someone would pull him up and he would gasp for air until there was none left. Their childhood was broken because a curse had befallen him. Sometimes when the boy began to slip again, he would wonder what sort of dream he’d been having when she left or was taken away. Sometimes he hoped he had been dreaming about her and her future of being a mother. \n\n\n\nTime came and time left and the world changed and the world did not. She did not come back. He saw girls all grown up with messy hair. He would hold their hands until they pulled away, threatening to call the cops, knowing they were not her. \n\n\n\nThe disease did not leave him but he grew up. And his sisters too and they married and left.\n\n\n\nAnd he learned that her life had been the world to him and it had lived. He would be waiting for a sign from her until his death. And he would wait for her after death.\n######################\nOutput:",

They met with scrofulous town’s men and they asked about her. By evening, Fifteen had grown scared. The Bishop went into his room to pray while the girls went to theirs to sleep. The third bed by the window remained empty for the night.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day, Bishop went into town to talk to the police. Two men followed him back and questioned the girls.\\n\\n“I was sleeping,” Seven said, her lips shaking, her visions becoming blurry and wet.\\n\\n“We talked before we fell asleep,” Thirteen said.\\n\\nFifteen gulped and sniffed and said he had heard footsteps go past his door by midnight.\\n\\n“It could have been the girl,” one of the policemen said.\\n\\n“She would not go out that late,” Bishop said.\\n\\n“And yet she is missing.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sarcasm was great and treacherous so much that Bishop pulled back and shivered. It would be the first time the boy was to see his father like this.\\n\\n“Has she ever done something like this before?”\\n\\n“No,” said Bishop tentatively.\\n\\n“We’ll search for her,” the second man said. “If she shows up, let us know.”\\n\\n\\n\\nShe did not show up that day.\\n\\n\\n\\nFifteen was troubled but more than that, he knew that he was lacking something and that he was living in the same knowledge everyone had. He searched the girls’ room, turning the sheets out, throwing the pillows aside until his heart ached. And he was searching like a mad man for a sign that could lead him to his sister. He turned the events of that day at the creek in his head. She knew nothing, would not leave the house unless he took her. Yet she was gone, disappearing like her existence was nothing, without a trace. In fact, she seemed like something he had made up in his mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nSearching for a sign—any kind— steered him to make the greatest discovery ever: scratch marks on the floor by her bed. They were small marks, easily forgotten but the boy had held her hands. He knew her and perhaps, yes, this was the sign he’d been waiting for.\\n\\n\\n\\nOr perhaps not. The marks had been made by Seven some time ago so that ruled everything out. By the ruling out of things, it meant that there was no single idea as to where she was. And yes, Ten stopped being Ten because a week had passed and her birthday too. The idea that she had left so suddenly or be taken away ripped the boy’s heart. The Bishop retreated steadily to his room and his hymns and the sun shone and the birds sang and the water flowed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a month later, after the boy had waited and prayed for a sign, that he knew, somehow, he had caught the virus. He would find himself plunging into an abyss, untethered, dead and he would not know how to breathe or what to do or what to say. It was a punch to his guts, the falling of everything that used to keep him in place because he had loved his sister in that delicate way of loving something one couldn’t touch, swaying in the tainted and staggering approach of the sun and the moon and the stars. And because he had gotten a version of her and her messy hair and childish candidness, he knew he had not made her up.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe found himself under the water of the bathtub, sinking and unable to breathe, dying. And something or someone would pull him up and he would gasp for air until there was none left. Their childhood was broken because a curse had befallen him. Sometimes when the boy began to slip again, he would wonder what sort of dream he’d been having when she left or was taken away. Sometimes he hoped he had been dreaming about her and her future of being a mother. \\n\\n\\n\\nTime came and time left and the world changed and the world did not. She did not come back. He saw girls all grown up with messy hair. He would hold their hands until they pulled away, threatening to call the cops, knowing they were not her. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe disease did not leave him but he grew up. And his sisters too and they married and left.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd he learned that her life had been the world to him and it had lived. He would be waiting for a sign from her until his death. And he would wait for her after death.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fifteen\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Fifteen is one of the girls who disappeared, concerned about his sister and searching for clues.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Bishop\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"The Bishop is a character who prays and searches for answers after hearing news about the missing girl.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Seven\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Seven is one of the girls, giving testimony to events that occurred before her disappearance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Thirteen\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Thirteen is another girl involved in the story, providing details of their interactions and the night of the disappearance.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Police Officers\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Police are mentioned as individuals who follow the Bishop back to question the girls about the missing girl.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Scrofulous Town\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Scrofulous Town is where the events of the story take place, a setting for the disappearance and the search.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Missing Girl\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The missing girl refers to an unnamed character who disappears, central to the plot and characters' concerns.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Bishop\\\"<|>\\\"Fifteen\\\"<|>\\\"Bishop prays while Fifteen searches for his sister, showing their shared concern.\\\"::<|>\\\"family, worry\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Seven\\\"<|>\\\"Missing Girl\\\"<|>\\\"Seven provides testimony about the night of the disappearance, indicating her knowledge of events.\\\"::<|>\\\"witness, missing girl's fate\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Thirteen\\\"<|>\\\"Fifteen\\\"<|>\\\"Thirteen supports Fifteen in his search for his sister and shares details with him.\\\"::<|>\\\"support, shared worry\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Police Officers\\\"<|>\\\"Missing Girl\\\"<|>\\\"The police officers question the girls about the missing girl, indicating their involvement in the search.\\\"::<|>\\\"officials, investigation\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Bishop\\\"<|>\\\"Scrofulous Town\\\"<|>\\\"The Bishop's actions and prayers are set against the backdrop of Scrofulous Town.\\\"::<|>\\\"location, spiritual guidance\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"disappearance, search for a sister, family, curse, childhood, loss\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

If her brother knew these things, it meant he had slipped into the library in town and had taken a book secretly. Bishop did not like that.\\n\\n“Well, it depends on how we view things and how we react to those things,” he said. He was paraphrasing but the idea was the same. “If we were to look at others in the same way as we view ourselves, we’d be able to understand it all.”\\n\\n“I don’t understand,” she said to him. \\n\\nHe nodded. Finally, they were home.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe water was plain and still and naked. The sun was low in the sky, the wind throwing a vortex of grasses and dewdrops. All four of them sat on the steps saying nothing. It was not all the time they were allowed happiness in the form of dancing sunlight and the sweet smell of clean water. \\n\\n“Tell us a story, Fifteen,” they said, shuffling their foot. Ten had curly hair so as she did that, they fell against her eyes. She blew air and laughed because she found quiet humor in the messiness. The other girls had straight hair like their mothers. Only the boy had a faint memory of her as he had told them before.\\n\\n\\n\\n“She went to help people in the other side of the world,” he had said to him. She had left them but perhaps it was because of Bishop and his stringent rules that had caused her departure. The boy had a vague memory of her face as she kissed his cheeks. He did not know her that well.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe others had simply forgotten about her. She was easy to forget because she did not call or write or say something to them. He remembered her only because he wanted to have something, anything, that was not one-sided.\\n\\n\\n\\n“I don’t have a story today,” he said, standing up. “But I want us to talk.”\\n\\nThe girls shook their heads.\\n\\nHe asked them, “What do you want when you grow up?”\\n\\n\\n\\nTen told him to start because she wanted to hear something dreamy, something tainted with the desire to become better.\\n\\n“I imagine I’m all grown up and married,” he started. “My wife might be a teacher or a librarian. I’ll have two daughters.”\\n\\n“What about me?” Seven asked, smiling shyly. \\n\\n“I imagine you working in a coffee shop, smiling at strangers with messy hair,” he said.\\n\\nShe thought about it for a while and then shook her head. “What is coffee?”\\n\\nAnd because the boy had only read about it, he said nothing.\\n\\nThirteen said, “I think I might become a chorister when I grow.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boy wanted to ask her why but chose not to. It was the sort of future she envisioned so he let her daydream about wearing white and golden robes and singing songs and hymns. He had never heard her sing but, of course, she would be exceptional.\\n\\nIt was Ten’s turn. “I think I might become a mother when I grow up.”\\n\\n\\n\\nA shimmer of rain began to fall and the children dashed back home. It was evening or maybe almost. For dinner, there was a bowl of spaghetti and mint sauce. Then, they crept into their rooms.

They slept in separate beds and dreamt separately but they lived together in simple lucidity.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe boy lived in the room two doors away. The room was small and had a single window and bars as though the Bishop believed he would someday run away. The bed was neat with two pillows. The lamplight reeked of still melancholy, the sort of feeling one might get from being lonely all of a sudden. In the bathroom, there was a single bar of Palmolive soap and a mirror broken at the sides like the claws of a witch. Fifteen fell asleep sometime around midnight although he swore he heard footsteps go past his door.\\n\\n\\n\\nBishop came to wake him up. “Get up, boy,” he said, “Where is Ten?”\\n\\nFifteen struggled on his feet and followed the grey-haired man out of the room. Ten’s bed was made, the pillow in neat positions. A corner of it was dipped, the sheets squeezed, a timely reminder that she had slept on the bed.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the women in white took the two girls into the painting room where she told them to carve out words. “Tell me where Ten is,” she said to them.\\n\\n“We don’t know,” they said, “She was gone when we woke up.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBishop took the boy out of the house.\\n\\nThe sun was out fully, the birds were singing beautifully. It was a graceful day. \\n\\n“Where do you think she might be?” Bishop asked, “Once I find her, I’m going to give her a good spanking.”\\n\\nIt was morning so they had the upper hand. Fifteen took the Bishop to the creek. It was quiet and undisturbed. They went through the town and they called her name and they strained their eyes against the sun. They met with scrofulous town’s men and they asked about her. By evening, Fifteen had grown scared. The Bishop went into his room to pray while the girls went to theirs to sleep. The third bed by the window remained empty for the night.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next day, Bishop went into town to talk to the police. Two men followed him back and questioned the girls.\\n\\n“I was sleeping,” Seven said, her lips shaking, her visions becoming blurry and\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Bishop\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Bishop is a strict and influential figure in the household, known for his stringent rules and harsh punishments.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Fifteen\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Fifteen is a boy who has vague memories of his mother and dreams about the future.

But his insistence\non the Americanism of his mind led to a broad identification with the as-\nsumptions of his own society which became closer as he grew older, and\nwhich was the exact antithesis of the outlook of Europe’s intelligentsia.\nEmerson was born in Boston in 1803, the son of a Unitarian minister. He\nbecame one himself but left the ministry because he could not conscien-\ntiously administer the Lord’s Supper. He travelled in Europe, discovered\nKant, returned and settled in Concord, Massachusetts, where he developed\nthe first indigenous American philosophical movement, known as Tran-\nscendentalism, encapsulated in his first book, Nature, published in 1836. It\nis neo-Platonic, somewhat anti-rational, a little mystical, a touch Romantic,\nabove all vague. Emerson noted in one of his many notebooks and journals:\nFor this was I born and came into the world to deliver the self of\nmyself to the Universe from the Universe; to do a certain benefit which\nnature could not forgo, nor I be discharged from rendering, and then\nemerge again into the holy silence and eternity, out of which as a man\nI arose. God is rich and many more men than I he harbours in his\nbosom, biding their time and the needs and beauty of all. Or, when\nI wish, it is permitted to me to say, these hands, this body, this history\nof Waldo Emerson are profane and wearisome, but I, I descend not\nto mix myself with that or any man. Above his life, above all creatures\nI flow down forever a sea of benefit into races of individuals. Nor can\nthe stream ever roll backwards or the sin or death of man taint the\nimmutable energy which distributes itself into men as the sun into\nrays or the sea into drops.2\nThis does not make much sense, or, in so far as it does, constitutes a\ntruism. But in an age which admired Hegelianism and the early Carlyle,\n139\nThe Deep Waters of Ernest Hemingway many Americans were proud that their young country had produced an\nundoubted intellectual of their own. It was later observed that his appeal\nrested ‘not on the ground that people understand him, but that they think\nsuch men ought to be encouraged’. 3 A year after he published Nature, he\ndelivered a Harvard address, entitled ‘The American Scholar’, which\nOliver Wendell Holmes was to call ‘our intellectual declaration of independ-\nence’.4 His themes were taken up by America’s burgeoning press. The paper\nwhich published Marx’s dispatches from Europe, Horace Greeley’s New\nYork Tribune, by far the most influential in the country, promoted Emerson’s\nTranscendentalism in a sensational manner, as a kind of national public\nproperty, like Niagara Falls.\nEmerson is worth examining because his career illustrates the difficulty\nexperienced by American intellectuals in breaking away from their native\nconsensus. In many ways he remained the product of his New England\nbackground, especially in his naive, puritanical and etiolated approach to\nsex. When he descended on the Carlyles at Craigenputtock in August 1833,\nhe seemed to Jane Carlyle a bit etherial, coming ‘out of the clouds, as it\nwere’; Carlyle himself noted he left ‘like an angel, with his beautiful,\ntransparent soul’.5 On a subsequent visit, in 1848, Emerson described in\nhis diary how he was obliged to defend American standards of morals at\na dinner party at John Foster’s house, attended by Dickens, Carlyle and\nothers:\nI said that, when I came to Liverpool, I enquired whether the prosti-\ntution was always as gross in that city, as it then appeared, for to me\nit seemed to betoken a fatal rottenness in the state, and I saw not how\nany boy could grow up safe. But I had been told, it was not worse or\nbetter for years. Carlyle and Dickens replied that chastity in the male\nsex was as good as gone in our times, and in England was so rare that\nthey could name all the exceptions. Carlyle evidently believed that\nthe same things were true in America…I assured him it was not so\nwith us; that, for the most part, young men of good standing and\ngood education with us, go virgins to their nuptial bed, as truly as\ntheir brides.6\nAs Henry James later wrote of Emerson, ‘his ripe unconsciousness of\nevil…is one of the most beautiful signs by which we know him’; though\nhe adds, cruelly, ‘We get the impression of a conscience gasping in the\nvoid, panting for sensations, with something of the movements of the gills\nof a landed fish.’7 Evidently the sexual drive in Emerson was not powerful.\nHis young first wife called him ‘Grandpa’. His second, who had to put up\nwith Emerson’s much-adored mother living in the household until she\ndied, occasionally gave vent to bitter remarks, which\n140\nIntellectuals\n######################\nOutput:",

He misinterpreted the criminal statistics, or ignored them\nwhen they did not support his thesis. Indeed he constantly and knowingly\nsuppresses facts that contradict his argument or explain away a particular\n‘iniquity’ he is seeking to expose. Careful checking of Engels’s extracts from\nhis secondary sources show these are often truncated, condensed, garbled\nor twisted, but invariably put in quotation marks as though given verbatim.\nThroughout the Henderson and Challoner edition of the book, footnotes\ncatalogue Engels’s distortions and dishonesties. In one section alone,\nChapter Seven, ‘The Proletariat’, falsehoods, including errors of fact and\ntranscription.24\nMarx cannot have been unaware of the weaknesses, indeed dishonesties,\nof Engels’s book since many of them were exposed in detail as early as 1848\nby the German economist Bruno Hildebrand, in a publication with which\nMarx was familiar.25 Moreover Marx himself compounds Engels’s misrep-\nresentations knowingly by omitting to tell the reader of the enormous im-\nprovements brought about by enforcement of the Factory Acts and other\nremedial legislation since the book was published and which affected\nprecisely the type of conditions he had highlighted. In any case, Marx\nbrought to the use of primary and secondary written sources the same\nspirit of gross carelessness, tendentious distortion and downright dishonesty\nwhich marked Engels’s work. 26 Indeed they were often collaborators in\ndeception, though Marx was the more audacious forger. In one particularly\nflagrant case he outreached himself. This was the so-called ‘Inaugural Ad-\ndress’ to the International Working Men’s Association, founded in Septem-\nber 1864. With the object of stirring the English working class from its\napathy, and anxious therefore to prove that living standards were falling,\nhe deliberately falsified a sentence from W. E. Gladstone’s Budget speech\nof 1863. What Gladstone said, commenting on the increase in national\nwealth, was: ‘I should look almost with apprehension and with pain upon\nthis intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power if it were my belief\nthat it was confined to the class who are in easy circumstances.’ But, he\nadded, ‘the average condition of the British labourer, we have the happiness\nto know, has improved during the last twenty years in a degree which we\nknow to be extraordinary, and which we may almost pronounce to be un-\nexampled in the history of any country and of any age.’27 Marx, in his ad-\ndress,\n66\nIntellectuals 6\nThe Deep Waters of\nErnest Hemingway\nA\nLTHOUGH the United States grew in numbers and strength throughout\nthe nineteenth century, and by the end of it had already become the\nworld’s largest and richest industrial power, it was a long time before\nits society began to produce intellectuals of the kind I have been describing.\nFor this there were several reasons. Independent America had never pos-\nsessed an ancien régime , a privileged establishment based on prescriptive\npossession rather than natural justice, There was no irrational and inequit-\nable existing order which the new breed of secular intellectual could scheme\nto replace by millenarian models based on reason and morality. On the\ncontrary: the United States was itself the product of a revolution against\nthe injustice of the old order. Its constitution was based on rational and\nethical principles, and had been planned, written, enacted and, in the light\nof early experience, amended by men of the highest intelligence, of philo-\nsophical bent and moral stature. There was thus no cleavage between the\nruling and the educated classes: they were one and the same. Then too, as\nde Tocqueville noted, there was in the United States no institutionalized\nclerical class, and therefore no anti-clericalism, the source of so much intel-\nlectual ferment in Europe. Religion in America was universal but under\nthe control of the laity. It concerned itself with behaviour, not dogma. It\nwas voluntary and multi-denominational, and thus expressed freedom\nrather than restricted it. Finally, America was a land of plenty and oppor-\ntunity, where land was cheap and in ample supply, and no man need be\npoor. There was none of the ocular evidence of flagrant injustice which, in\nEurope, incited clever, well-educated men to embrace radical\n138 ideas. No sins cried out to heaven for vengeance-yet. Most men were too\nbusy getting and spending, exploiting and consolidating, to question the\nfundamental assumptions of their society.\nEarly American intellectuals, like Washington Irving, took their tone and\nmanners, their style and content, from Europe, where they spent much of\ntheir time; they were a living legacy of cultural colonialism. The emergence\nof a native and independent American intellectual spirit was itself a reaction\nto the cringing of Irving and his kind. The first and most representative\nexponent of this spirit-the archetypal American intellectual of the nineteenth\ncentury-was Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82), who proclaimed that his\nobject was to extract ‘the tape-worm of Europe’ from America’s body and\nbrain, to ‘cast out the passion for Europe by the passion for America’.1 He\ntoo went to Europe but in a critical and rejecting mood. But his insistence\non the Americanism of his mind led to a broad identification with the as-\nsumptions of his own\n######################\nOutput:",
